# Netstead + corral

This repo holds **two PyPI packages with separate utility and separate audiences**. Each ships its own documentation site:

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-database-outline:{ .lg .middle } &nbsp;**corral**

    ---

    Generic engine for **Frictionless tabular data packages** — any spec. Lazy DuckDB compute (via ibis); pandas / polars / Arrow in and out. Reads CSV / Parquet / DuckDB / zip-CSV from local paths and URLs with a credentials cascade. Composable primitives for validation, scope, editing, HTTP and MCP.

    Pick corral if you're working with **any Frictionless data package** — GTFS-derived feeds, OGD datasets, a custom internal spec, or building your own toolkit.

    GMNS-specific toolkit on top of corral. Adds the `Network` class, the vendored GMNS spec (0.95 / 0.96 / 0.97), network-aware scope operations, the data-quality rule pack, optional editing tools with rollback, and an optional self-hosted HTTP server + MCP server.

    Pick netstead if you're working with **transportation networks** — DOT / MPO planning, travel-demand modeling, GTFS ↔ GMNS interop, OSM-derived routing graphs.

## Which package do I install?

Installing `netstead` brings `corral` along automatically. You only install `corral` directly if you're working on something non-GMNS.

```bash
pip install netstead            # GMNS toolkit (brings corral with it)
pip install dbcorral         # generic engine only — for non-GMNS use cases
```
