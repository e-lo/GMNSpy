# Visual tour

## What you'll build

You'll work through the bundled Leavenworth, WA network in one notebook session and produce, in order:

1. A folium / matplotlib map of the full network.
2. A validation report rendered as an HTML card.
3. A data-quality report grouped by severity.
4. A simplify-geometry edit, rendered as a before/after diff (then rolled back).
5. A scoped subgraph around a single node, rendered side-by-side with the original.

Total runtime: under two minutes on a laptop. The fixture is ~5 MB and ships inside the `gmnspy` wheel.

## Prerequisites

The `[clean]` extra brings in `shapely` + `igraph` for geometry simplification and scope operations. The `[notebook]` extra brings in `ipywidgets` so the `_repr_html_` cards render in classic Jupyter as well as JupyterLab.

```bash
pip install 'gmnspy[clean,notebook]'
```

For the map steps, either `folium` (interactive Leaflet) or `matplotlib` (static fallback) works — pick one:

```bash
pip install folium       # interactive Leaflet map
pip install matplotlib   # static fallback
```

The steps below show both paths.

## Steps

### 1. Load the fixture

Start by loading the bundled Leavenworth network. `Network.from_source` returns a lazy `Network` — no rows have been read from disk yet; `net.links` is still an ibis expression.

```python
from gmnspy import Network
from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth

net = Network.from_source(leavenworth.csv_dir())
print(f"{net.spec_version}: {net.links.count()} links, {net.nodes.count()} nodes")
```

You should see:

```text
0.97: 214 links, 75 nodes
```

In a notebook, evaluating `net` on its own renders an HTML summary card with the spec version, table inventory, and a thumbnail map.

*Network summary card (`net._repr_html_()`). Spec version 0.97, 25 tables, 214 links / 75 nodes, with a thumbnail of the link geometry.*

### 2. Render the network as a map

The `link` table is keyed to `geometry` by `geometry_id`; the `geometry.geometry` column carries the WKT LineString per link. Materialise both with `.to_pandas()` and join them before plotting.

```python
import pandas as pd
from shapely import wkt

links = net.links.to_pandas()
geoms = net.tables["geometry"].to_pandas().set_index("geometry_id")
links = links.join(geoms[["geometry"]], on="geometry_id")
links["shape"] = links["geometry"].map(wkt.loads)
```

For an interactive Leaflet map, use folium. Compute the centroid from the node table, then add one PolyLine per link.

```python
import folium

# Centroid of the network — average node y/x
nodes = net.nodes.to_pandas()
center = [nodes["y_coord"].mean(), nodes["x_coord"].mean()]

m = folium.Map(location=center, zoom_start=15, tiles="cartodbpositron")
for shape in links["shape"]:
    coords = [(y, x) for x, y in shape.coords]  # folium wants (lat, lon)
    folium.PolyLine(coords, color="#1f77b4", weight=2, opacity=0.8).add_to(m)
m  # in a notebook, this renders the map inline
```

You should see the downtown Leavenworth grid — a compact, walkable core wrapped around Highway 2 / Front Street, surrounded by a few residential tertiary streets.

*Folium map of the full Leavenworth fixture. The compact downtown grid is visible around Highway 2, with tertiary residential streets fanning out.*

If `folium` isn't available, the static matplotlib fallback gives an equivalent view (without basemap tiles):

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 8))
for shape in links["shape"]:
    xs, ys = shape.xy
    ax.plot(xs, ys, color="#1f77b4", linewidth=1.0, alpha=0.8)
ax.set_aspect("equal")
ax.set_title(f"Leavenworth GMNS fixture — {len(links)} links")
plt.show()
```

Either way: a recognisable Bavarian-themed downtown core in roughly 600 m of OSM-derived street network.

### 3. Validate and display the report

`net.validate()` runs the four-pass validator (structural / schema / FK / sync-state) and returns a `ValidationReport`. In a notebook, evaluating the report on its own renders a styled HTML card.

```python
report = net.validate()
report  # in a notebook, the _repr_html_ renders a styled card
```

You should see a green header ("0 errors") with a per-pass summary. The Leavenworth fixture is clean by construction — no ERRORs.

![Validation report card for the Leavenworth fixture](../assets/screenshots/leavenworth-validation-report.png){ .screenshot }
*Validation report card. Zero ERRORs, with the four passes (structural / schema / FK / sync-state) summarised across 25 tables.*

In a non-notebook context, drop down to the text representation:

```python
print(f"{report.spec_version}: {len(report.issues)} issues")
for issue in report.issues[:5]:
    print(f"  {issue.severity.value:9} {issue.code:30} {issue.message[:60]}")
```

### 4. Run quality and display

The data-quality pack flags things the spec is silent on but every real network has — disconnected components, lane-count mismatches, high speeds on residential facilities, near-duplicate nodes. Run it the same way as validation; the result has its own `_repr_html_`.

```python
from datagrove.quality import run_quality

qreport = run_quality(net)
qreport  # _repr_html_ renders severity-grouped findings
```

You should see a card with WARNING / INFO findings (no ERRORs). Leavenworth's tertiary streets carry posted speeds in the 25-30 mph range with `facility_type=residential`, which trips `quality.high_speed_residential` when configured with a low threshold — useful for seeing what a real finding looks like.

![Quality report card for the Leavenworth fixture](../assets/screenshots/leavenworth-quality-report.png){ .screenshot }
*Quality report card. Severity-grouped findings; the residential-speed rule fires on a handful of tertiary streets.*

To see the top findings in detail, iterate over `qreport.issues`:

```python
for issue in qreport.issues[:3]:
    print(f"  {issue.severity.value:9} {issue.code:35} {issue.message}")
```

### 5. Simplify geometry and render before/after

The `simplify_geometry` op in `gmnspy.clean` removes redundant vertices from link geometries. Wrap it in a `Session` so the edit can be rolled back atomically.

```python
from datagrove.editing import Session
from gmnspy.clean import simplify_geometry

with Session(net) as s:
    edit = simplify_geometry(net, s, mode="redundant_only", tolerance=1.0)
    edit  # in a notebook, _repr_html_ shows the diff (vertices removed per link)
```

You should see an `EditResult` diff card listing the number of vertices removed per affected link. `mode="redundant_only"` removes only colinear vertices and is loss-free; `mode="douglas_peucker"` is the lossy alternative with an explicit tolerance.

![EditResult diff card for the simplify-geometry edit](../assets/screenshots/leavenworth-simplify-edit-result.png){ .screenshot }
*EditResult diff card. Per-link vertex counts before / after, with a summary of links touched and vertices removed.*

To visualise before-and-after on one map, snapshot the geometry before opening the session, then overlay both:

```python
links_before = links[["link_id", "shape"]].copy()
# (run the simplify edit above inside the Session)
links_after_geoms = net.tables["geometry"].to_pandas().set_index("geometry_id")
links_after = links.copy()
links_after["shape"] = links_after["geometry_id"].map(
    lambda gid: wkt.loads(links_after_geoms.loc[gid, "geometry"])
)

m = folium.Map(location=center, zoom_start=15, tiles="cartodbpositron")
for shape in links_before["shape"]:
    folium.PolyLine([(y, x) for x, y in shape.coords],
                    color="#888", weight=4, opacity=0.4).add_to(m)
for shape in links_after["shape"]:
    folium.PolyLine([(y, x) for x, y in shape.coords],
                    color="#d62728", weight=1.5, opacity=0.9).add_to(m)
m
```

Grey underneath = before; red on top = after. On Leavenworth most links don't change (the OSM source is already minimal), but a handful of curved tertiary links visibly simplify.

To restore the original state, roll the session back:

```python
s.rollback()
```

The session's chronological log reverses every edit atomically — the network returns byte-identical to step 1.

### 6. Build a scope from a single node and render

`from_node` builds a network-distance-bounded subgraph around a seed node. The 200 m buffer below is Dijkstra-bounded along the routable graph — links that are spatially close but only reachable via long detours fall outside.

```python
from gmnspy.scope import from_node

scoped = from_node(net, node_id=1, network_buffer="200m").apply()
print(f"scoped: {scoped.links.count()} links, {scoped.nodes.count()} nodes")
```

Every related table (`lane`, `link_tod`, `movement`, signal tables) is pre-filtered by FK chain, so the result is a self-consistent GMNS network you can write back out.

Render the scope side-by-side with the original to see the contrast — full network as grey context, scoped subgraph highlighted.

```python
scoped_links = scoped.links.to_pandas().join(geoms[["geometry"]], on="geometry_id")
scoped_links["shape"] = scoped_links["geometry"].map(wkt.loads)

m = folium.Map(location=center, zoom_start=15, tiles="cartodbpositron")
# Full network, faint
for shape in links["shape"]:
    folium.PolyLine([(y, x) for x, y in shape.coords],
                    color="#bbb", weight=1, opacity=0.5).add_to(m)
# Scope, highlighted
for shape in scoped_links["shape"]:
    folium.PolyLine([(y, x) for x, y in shape.coords],
                    color="#2ca02c", weight=3, opacity=0.95).add_to(m)
m
```

You should see a small green subgraph centred on one intersection, with the rest of the network greyed out as context.

![Scoped subgraph rendered next to the full Leavenworth network](../assets/screenshots/leavenworth-scoped-map.png){ .screenshot }

## Variations you might try

Each accordion below is a one-line tweak that shows off a different facet of the toolkit. Pick whichever matches what you want to learn next.

???+ note "Try a different fixture or your own network"
    The bundled fixture is Leavenworth. Point `Network.from_source` at any GMNS package on disk or in cloud storage to repeat the tour with your own data — every step above is fixture-agnostic.

    ```python
    net = Network.from_source("./my-network/")
    net = Network.from_source("s3://my-bucket/network.parquet/")
    ```

??? note "Switch to the pandas engine for eager evaluation"
    The default ibis + DuckDB engine is lazy. Switch to pandas if you'd rather have every table materialised up-front (handy for small fixtures where you'll touch every row).

    ```python
    from datagrove.engines.pandas_engine import PandasEngine

    net = Network.from_source(leavenworth.csv_dir(), engine=PandasEngine())
    ```

??? note "Configure a custom quality threshold"
    Override the `quality.high_speed_residential` threshold (default is conservative). Tightening it surfaces more findings on a network with mixed posted speeds.

    ```python
    from datagrove.quality import RuleConfig, run_quality

    qreport = run_quality(
        net,
        config={
            "quality.high_speed_residential": RuleConfig(
                thresholds={"speed_limit_mph": 30.0}
            )
        },
    )
    ```
