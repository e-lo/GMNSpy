# Design records — index

This folder is the one place for netstead / corral planning: decisions, product requirements,
feature designs, implementation plans and scoping studies. It is internal (excluded from the
published sites by `exclude_docs` in the root `mkdocs.yml`) but lives in git, so every record is
reviewed in a PR like code.

**What lives where**

| Question | Source of truth |
|---|---|
| How is the software built *today*? | [`packages/corral/docs/architecture.md`](../../packages/corral/docs/architecture.md) |
| Why did we choose X over Y? | an **ADR** here |
| What should a feature do, and for whom? | a **PRD** or **Design** here |
| How do we build it, step by step? | a **Plan** here |
| Is X worth doing, and how big is it? | a **Scope** here |
| What exactly is left to do? | GitHub issues, linked from the record |
| What shipped in a release? | `packages/*/CHANGELOG.md` |

On conflict: architecture.md > accepted ADRs > PRDs / designs > plans > issue bodies > code comments.
When a decision changes, write a new ADR (or amend the old one's status), then update
architecture.md and this index in the same PR.

## Conventions

- **File name:** `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>-<kind>.md`, e.g. `2026-10-01-geometry-encoding-adr.md`.
  Kinds: `adr`, `prd`, `design`, `plan`, `scope`. A few older records predate this rule; they
  keep their names because other records link to them.
- **Status line** right under the title:
  `Status: **<status>** (<PRs>) · Date: … · Owner: …`. Statuses:
  - `proposed` — open for review
  - `accepted` — agreed, not yet built
  - `implemented` — merged; cite the PRs
  - `superseded` — replaced; link the replacement
  - `abandoned` — not pursued
- **Mark, don't delete.** When a record is done or overtaken, update its status and add a short
  note at the top saying what changed. The reasoning is the value; don't rewrite history in the body.
- **Plans** close out by setting `implemented` in the PR that finishes them.
- Update the table below in the same PR as any status change.

## In flight (not on `main` yet)

These records exist on branches. Add them to the tables above when they merge.

| Record | Kind | Where | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `2026-10-05-workbench-plugins-design.md` — entry-point plugin API (`netstead.workbench.plugins`), core owns network nouns, ProjectCard editing moves to an external plugin repo | design | `feat/workbench-plugins`, PR pending | accepted; Part 1 implemented. **Amends the Workbench design:** the in-core `changes/` package it planned is superseded; core stays card-agnostic |
| `2026-10-05-workbench-plugins-p1-plan.md` — Part 1, Python plugin core | plan | `feat/workbench-plugins`, PR pending | implemented (PR pending) |

## Gaps to close

- **No product-level PRD.** #98 was closed in favour of this index plus architecture.md §1. If a
  roadmap to GA and past it is wanted, add it here as `YYYY-MM-DD-netstead-prd.md`.
- **Workbench LAN exposure:** `netstead app --host 0.0.0.0` with an empty `io.allowed_roots` lets
  anyone on the network browse the home directory. Documented, not blocked; consider refusing a
  non-loopback host without explicit roots.
- **Quality-rule backlog** from pre-v1 issues: partially overlapping segments (#5) and unique
  natural-key combinations such as `link_id` + `time_day` (#7).
