# Workbench P2 (Validate + Edit) Implementation Plan

Status: **proposed** (branch `feat/workbench-p2`) · Date: 2026-10-07 · Refreshed: 2026-10-10 · Owner: Elizabeth Sall

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

> **Re-scoped 2026-10-07.** The first draft of this plan (commit `eeaa01b` on this branch, "Validate + Fix +
> Change log") put ProjectCards in core: a `netstead.changes` package (`NetworkChange`, `DraftCard`,
> `ChangeLog`), a vendored projectcard schema, a `[projectcard]` extra and a Changes tab. The accepted
> [plugins design](2026-10-05-workbench-plugins-design.md) moves all of that to an external **cards** plugin. This
> revision is **core only**: validate the network, edit its tables directly, see live warnings, and save a copy.
> The ProjectCard research is kept in [the cards plugin scope](2026-10-07-cards-plugin-scope.md); see
> [Moved to the cards plugin](#moved-to-the-cards-plugin).

> **Refreshed 2026-10-10 against Plugins Parts 1 and 2 as built.** Tasks 5 onward were first written against the
> Part 1 *plan* and the pre-Part-2 front end. They are rewritten here against the code on
> `feat/workbench-plugins-p2` (Part 1 is merged as #222; Part 2 is PR #223). What changed, in short:
> - `Session.mutate` (as built) edits a copy-on-write draft and swaps it in; a failing Action rolls back through
>   `Session._undo`. P2's pending-edit ledger joins that rollback, and P2 adds `Session.revert` (the swap run
>   backwards) under `undo_last`. The ledger's `source` comes from Part 1's `origin` argument; no new `source=`.
> - A `mutate` outside any Action is already recorded as a non-replayable entry; P2 records its pending edit as
>   source `"python"`, and a revert outside an Action the same way (`python.revert`).
> - The stored selection now follows an edit (new Task 6).
> - Host additions move to their own task (Task 7) and bump `HOST_API` from Part 2's 1.1 to **1.2**.
> - New core Actions keep "copy session as Python" byte-identical for old sessions: the script header line is frozen
>   at the nine pre-P2 Actions, and each new core Action brings its own import line (Task 8).
> - The front end registers through Part 2's slots: the Issues and Edits panels through `addPanel` with badges, issue
>   markers through `addLayer`, Edit/Delete/Fix/Undo/Run validation/Save a copy through the commands registry and the
>   palette, and the record editor through `schemaForm` (Tasks 13–17).
> Tasks 1–4 are unchanged: nothing they touch changed in Parts 1–2 (re-run, see the honesty note).

## Built on Plugins Parts 1 and 2 (read this first)

**Plugin Part 1, then Part 2, then P2** (decided 2026-10-08 and 2026-10-10). P2 starts from Part 2's branch tip, or
from `main` once #223 has merged. It uses these pieces, as built:

| Piece (as built) | What P2 does with it |
|---|---|
| `BaseAction`, `CORE_ACTIONS`, per-session `ActionRegistry` (`actions.py`) | P2's six Actions subclass `BaseAction` and are **appended to `CORE_ACTIONS` and to the `Action` union** (Decided (recommendation) 2026-10-10, below). |
| `Session._handlers` built from `_do_<type>`; job Actions run `_job_<type>` (`Session.submit`) | P2's handlers are `_do_<type>` / `_job_<type>` methods: no registration code. |
| `HistoryEntry.imports`, `import_line`, `script_imports` (`routes/core.py` `/api/history`), `history.js` `sessionScript` | New core Actions import from `netstead.workbench`; `script_imports` keeps the pre-P2 header line (Task 8). |
| `Session.mutate(net_id, edits, *, note, origin=None)`: edits a `derived_copy` draft, swaps with `NetworkHandle.replace_tables`, pushes a `_Mutated` undo record inside an Action, records `<origin>.mutate` outside one | Every P2 edit goes through it. P2 adds `recheck=`, the pending-edit ledger and its undo record, live re-checks and the selection rule (Tasks 5–6). |
| Dispatch-level rollback (`Session._running`, `Session._undo`, `_roll_back`) | A failed Action also undoes its pending edits (`_LedgerMark`, Task 5). |
| `Session.network`, `selection_copy`, `derive` | Routes and Host read through `network`; `derive` stays the plugins' preview tool (Decision 3). |
| `Host` (`plugins/host.py`): `selection`, `network`, `mutate` (passes `origin=plugin id`), `derive`, `dispatch`, `writable` | P2 adds `undo`, `edit_warnings`, `plan_update/plan_delete/plan_add` (Task 7, `HOST_API` 1.1 → **1.2**). |
| `describe_error`, `scrub` (`redact.py`) | Plugin failures stay scrubbed; `SaveNetwork` scrubs corral's warning text. |
| Tests: `make_session` / `make_hello` (`test_workbench_plugins.py`), the autouse `_no_installed_workbench_plugins` fixture, `@pytest.mark.plugin_discovery` | P2's sessions pass `plugins=[]` (or a test plugin); none needs real discovery. |
| Part 2 slots: `addPanel` / `showPanel` / `renderStrips` (`workspaces.js`), `addLayer` (`map.js`), `addCommandTo` + `runCommand` + `commandContext` (`commands.js`), `slots` / `CORE` / `ALL_WORKSPACES` (`slots.js`), `schemaForm` (`formview.js`), `networkBadge` (`tabs.js`) | The Issues and Edits panels, the issue layer, P2's commands, the record editor, and the switcher badge (Tasks 14–17). |

## Decisions from the user

Every question this plan raised is decided. None is open.

**Decided 2026-10-07 (with the re-scope):**
- **Edits are allowed, with non-blocking schema warnings** (the user's answer 3). Table values are edited in the
  Workbench: cell edits in the table, and the fix editor launched from an issue or from Details. An edit that the
  spec disagrees with (a foreign key not in the referenced table, a required field left empty, a wrong type or a
  value outside the enum, a duplicate primary key) is **applied** and shown as an edit warning on the cell, the row
  and the Issues panel, so the user can go and fix it. Only what the storage cannot hold is refused (Decision 1).
- **Save writes a new copy.** Edits live on the open handle, in memory; the source (a local folder or `s3://…`) is
  never written. `SaveNetwork` writes a **new** copy inside `io.allowed_roots`, never overwrites, and reports
  corral's `OutOfSyncWarning` as text. Before saving, the outstanding warnings are shown; while any remain, saving
  needs an explicit confirmation (`accept_warnings=True`).
- **ProjectCards are not core.** Everything card-shaped moves to the cards plugin (see
  [Moved to the cards plugin](#moved-to-the-cards-plugin)).

**(a) Undo. Decided 2026-10-08:** the last edit only, one at a time, no redo. Undo is itself a recorded Action.
- `UndoEdit` reverses the network's **last** pending edit (LIFO, one per click). It is recorded in history like any
  Action, so a replayed session reproduces the same network.
- Core undoes only core edits. When the last change came from a plugin (`host.mutate`), core's Undo is refused with
  the plugin's name ("undo it in cards"); the plugin undoes its own through `host.undo` (Task 7). This keeps a
  plugin's state (a draft card) in step with the network.
- No redo: re-applying is re-dispatching the `EditCells` shown in the history strip.

**(b) Add and delete. Decided 2026-10-08:** delete a link in the UI; add rows from Python and the API only.
- **Delete** is in Details, the fix editor, and the map feature / table row context menus. Deleting a link cascades
  to the rows that depend on it through the spec's foreign keys (`lane`, `link_tod`, then their own dependents), as
  one undoable edit. Before anything is removed, a confirmation shows what will go
  (`POST …/table/{name}/delete-plan`: rows per table). Deleting a node that a link still references is refused,
  naming the links.
- **Add** is `AddRows`, from Python and the API, for any table with a primary key. There is no draw tool. Added links
  without geometry draw as straight lines between their nodes (`viz/buffers` already falls back to node
  coordinates).

**(c) Re-validation. Decided 2026-10-08:** live per-edit checks, plus a stale full validation with a manual Re-run.
- **Live, per edit:** after every mutation the session checks the rows edits have touched (by key) against the
  spec: foreign key, required, type and enum, duplicate primary key (Task 4). These edit warnings are always current.
- **The full validation and quality run** (`RunValidation`) is marked **stale** when the network version moves past
  the one it ran on. The Issues panel says so and offers a manual **Re-run** button. Export report is refused until
  it is re-run. There is no automatic re-run.

**(d) Sequencing. Decided 2026-10-08, extended 2026-10-10:** plugin Part 1, then Part 2, then P2 (see
[Built on Plugins Parts 1 and 2](#built-on-plugins-parts-1-and-2-read-this-first)).

**Decided (recommendation) 2026-10-10** (made while refreshing the plan against the built code; each is the
recommended answer, recorded so the user can see and overturn it):
- **R1. `Session.revert` is the undo primitive.** `revert(net_id, results, *, note, origin=None)` reverses the
  network's newest pending edit on a copy-on-write draft and swaps it in, exactly as `mutate` swaps edits in: the
  version is bumped, the lineage records the note, state is published, a failing Action rolls it back, and outside an
  Action it is recorded as a non-replayable `<origin>.revert` entry. It refuses anything but the newest pending
  edit's results (corral reverses an edit against the table that edit left). `undo_last(net_id, *, source)` finds
  that entry, checks its source, and calls `revert`; `UndoEdit` and `host.undo` call `undo_last`. *Why:* the
  in-place `reverse_edit` + `bump()` that Part 1's test uses skips the undo record, the lineage and the publish.
- **R2. The pending-edit ledger records the results it reverses.** `mutate` does not write history (the calling
  Action does), so each mutation's `EditResult`s go into the network's ledger entry. `UndoEdit` locates them there;
  nothing is stored on the history entry. The ledger joins the dispatch-level rollback (a snapshot undo record), so a
  failed Action leaves no pending edit behind.
- **R3. The ledger's source comes from Part 1's `origin`.** A plugin's `host.mutate` passes its id; a core Action's
  `mutate` (inside an Action, no origin) is `"workbench"`; a `mutate` outside any Action is `"python"`, matching the
  `python.mutate` history entry Part 1 writes. Core's Undo undoes `"workbench"` entries only; Python can undo its own
  with `session.undo_last(net_id, source="python")`.
- **R4. The selection follows an edit.** After every `mutate` and `revert` on the selected network: a selection made
  by a **query** (an utterance, whose parsed intent the payload now keeps as `intent`) is resolved again on the
  edited network; a selection made by **ids** (clicks, "Set as selection") keeps its ids minus any link that no longer
  exists, and becomes no selection when none is left. This replaces the first draft's Decision 15 ("a deletion clears
  a selection that includes a deleted link"). It is deterministic, so a replayed session agrees, and a failed Action
  restores the old selection through Part 1's rollback.
- **R5. New core Actions join `CORE_ACTIONS` *and* the `Action` union.** `parse_action` returns an `Action` and the
  core registry parses every `CORE_ACTIONS` member, so the union must list them too (Part 1's test pins the two
  equal). Plugin Actions still never join the union.
- **R6. The script header stays frozen at the nine pre-P2 Actions.** `script_imports` heads every script with
  `from netstead.workbench import Session, OpenNetwork, …, SetSetting`, byte for byte as today; a later core Action
  that a session used adds one `from netstead.workbench import <Name>` line after it, once.
- **R7. Issues and Edits are dock panels in every workspace** (`workspace: "*"`, like Details), not only Inspect: a
  plugin's Edit workspace changes the same network, so its warnings and undo stay in view. Their badges read the
  server state (`issues`, `edits`), so they refresh with every `state` event. Hiding the issue markers is Part 2's
  Overlays switch (`hiddenLayers`), replacing the first draft's `showIssues` toggle.
- **R8. Record edits and deletes are context commands.** Core registers `edit_record` ("Edit…") and
  `delete_record` ("Delete…") for the `feature` and `row` contexts, and the palette commands `fix_issue`,
  `undo_edit`, `run_validation` and `save_copy`; the Issues panel's Fix button runs `fix_issue` through
  `runCommand`. With these registered, a right-click on a link, a node or a keyed row always opens a menu (Part 2's
  rule: a menu opens when a command applies).
- **R9. The record editor is a `schemaForm`.** Details → Edit… (and the `edit_record` command) shows a generated form
  over the record's editable columns and sends one `EditCells` with only the changed values; the fix editor (from an
  issue) is the same form narrowed to the issue's column. Types come from the table schema (`num`, `bool`, `str`);
  the server still coerces and refuses (Decision 1).
- **R10. `HOST_API` goes to 1.2** (Part 2 took 1.1): `Host.undo`, `Host.edit_warnings` and `Host.plan_*` are new
  plugin API.

---

**Goal:** Validate a network in the Workbench and fix what it finds by editing its tables directly.
- **Validate.** "Run validation" runs `Network.validate` plus the quality rules as a background job, with the rule
  config from Settings → `validation.rules`. An **Issues** dock panel links issue ↔ map marker ↔ table row. It
  filters by severity, table and code, and lists unlocated issues separately. An edit marks the result stale;
  one click re-runs it. **Export report** downloads the existing `render_validation_html` page.
- **Edit.** Cell edits in the data table (click a cell of the focused row), the record editor (Details → Edit…, or
  Edit… on a feature or row), and the fix editor launched from an issue. Each edit is a recorded Action
  (`EditCells`, `DeleteRows`, `AddRows`) applied through `Session.mutate` as corral `Edit`s (`update_rows`,
  `delete_rows`, `add_rows`): recorded in history, with a network version bump and a lineage entry.
- **Live warnings.** After each edit, the touched rows are checked against the spec. Warnings show on the cell, the
  row and the Issues panel, and never block.
- **Pending edits.** An **Edits** dock panel lists the pending edits (with their source: the Workbench, Python or a
  plugin), **Undo last**, the open warnings, and **Save a copy**. A dirty badge marks unsaved edits on the panel tab,
  the workspace tab and in the network switcher (plugins design, UX principle 7).

**Architecture:**
- **Edit planning is pure.** `workbench/editing.py` turns a request into an `EditPlan` (corral `Edit`s, a summary,
  rows per table) and refuses only what the storage cannot hold. `workbench/editcheck.py` checks rows against the
  spec. Neither mutates.
- **One mutation path, and its mirror.** Every edit, core or plugin, goes through `Session.mutate`; every undo through
  `Session.revert`. Both swap a draft in (`_swap`), add or drop a `PendingEdit` in the network's `EditLedger`, re-run
  the live checks over every key the ledger has touched (so a later edit that fixes a foreign key clears the earlier
  warning), move the selection (R4), then publish or record (`_settle`).
- **Validation is a job**, like Open and Build. `Session._commit` is generalised: a job returns an *outcome* with a
  `commit(session)` method (`_Loaded`, `_Validated`, `_Saved`), still committed and recorded in one critical
  section.
- **Issues are tied to records at validation time.** A rule reports a row *position*, which is only meaningful in
  the table order it read, at that version. `locate_issues` turns positions into primary keys and an `anchor`
  (`{"link": id}`, `{"node": id}` or `{"lonlat": [x, y]}`). The browser places anchors from the network buffer it
  has already decoded.
- **Host API 1.2** (additive): `host.selection` carries the ProjectCard facility form; `host.mutate` records its
  plugin as the source; `host.undo`, `host.edit_warnings` and `host.plan_update/plan_delete/plan_add` let the cards
  plugin lower card changes onto core edits with core's refusal rules.
- New read-only routes, none recorded: `GET …/issues`, `…/issues/markers`, `…/report.html`, `…/edits`, and
  `POST …/table/{name}/delete-plan`.
- Front end, on Part 2's slots:
  - the dock gains two core panels, **Issues** and **Edits** (`addPanel`, badges from the server state), beside
    Details;
  - issue markers are a core layer in the layer registry (`addLayer(CORE, "roadway", "issues", …)`), listed under
    Layers → Overlays;
  - Edit…, Delete…, Fix the picked issue…, Undo last edit, Run validation and Save a copy… are registered commands
    (feature / row context menus and the palette);
  - an edit (same network id, new version) keeps the focus, highlights, table, page and scope, instead of resetting
    them the way a network switch does;
  - pure rules live in import-free `issuelist.js` and `editmodel.js`, unit-tested under node;
  - DOM wiring lives in `issues.js`, `fixeditor.js`, `edits.js`, `editcmds.js` and `table.js` (cell editing).

**Tech Stack:**
- Python 3.11, pydantic v2, FastAPI.
- ibis 12 on DuckDB through corral. No raw SQL: `lint_no_sql.py` must stay clean.
- **No new dependencies.** (The first draft's `[projectcard]` extra is gone with the cards.)
- MapLibre GL 4.7.1 and deck.gl 9.0.38 (already loaded). Native ES modules, no build step. Node only in tests.

**Spec:**
- [2026-10-02-netstead-workbench-design.md](2026-10-02-netstead-workbench-design.md): §b "Inspect & Validate
  workspace" (Validation and Fixing) and the phasing row P2. Its "Two audit logs" and `NetworkChange` parts are
  superseded by the plugins design.
- [2026-10-05-workbench-plugins-design.md](2026-10-05-workbench-plugins-design.md): UX principles 1 (core owns the
  network nouns), 3 (nothing mutates silently), 4 (everything is an Action) and 7 (dirty state is visible); `Host`.
- [2026-10-08-workbench-plugins-p2-plan.md](2026-10-08-workbench-plugins-p2-plan.md), "What P2 changes": the dock,
  layer and command slots P2 registers into.

**Branch:** `feat/workbench-p2` holds this plan. The implementation gets `feat/workbench-p2-impl`, cut from Part 2's
tip (`origin/feat/workbench-plugins-p2`) or from `main` once #223 has merged.

**Conventions:**
- Run commands from the repo root.
- **Tiered tests:**
  - while iterating, the task's own paths: `uv run --all-extras pytest <paths> -q`;
  - before every commit: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` (the fast default tier);
  - before merge, once, in Task 18: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q -m ""` (everything, including
    `slow` and `perf`).
- Lint: `uv run ruff check packages && uv run ruff format --check packages`. Task 18 also runs `uv run lint-imports`
  and `uv run python scripts/lint_no_sql.py`.
- Ruff enforces Google-style docstrings (`D`) outside `tests/`, line length 120. `--doctest-modules` is on, so every
  `>>>` example below is a test.
- Not every snippet below is pre-wrapped to 120 columns. After pasting, run `uv run ruff format <files>`, then the
  check pair.
- `filterwarnings = error`: a stray warning fails a test. Writing an edited network raises corral's
  `OutOfSyncWarning`, which Task 11 handles deliberately.
- Never write under `netstead/fixtures` (the conftest guard fails the session). Mutating tests load their own
  network per test and write to `tmp_path`.
- Sessions in tests pass `plugins=[]` (or a test plugin). The autouse `_no_installed_workbench_plugins` fixture
  already keeps real entry points out; no P2 test needs `@pytest.mark.plugin_discovery`.
- Fixtures: **Leavenworth** (`leavenworth.parquet_dir()`: 339 links, 121 nodes, 429 lanes, 1 `link_tod` row, plus
  `geometry`) for anything edit- or validation-shaped; its CSV copy (`leavenworth.csv_dir()`) where a null matters;
  **RDU** (link + node only) where the existing session tests use it. Session tests use the `isolated_env` fixture
  (its allowed roots are `tmp_path` plus the fixture trees).
- Pure front-end logic goes in import-free modules, tested with the `node_module` fixture (`conftest.py`). DOM
  wiring is covered by the static tests (`test_relative_imports_resolve_to_real_exports`,
  `test_every_element_id_used_by_js_exists_in_index`, `test_js_syntax`, and Part 2's dock and palette tests) and by
  the browser walk-through in Task 18.
- **corral `Table.filter` takes an expression transform, not a predicate.** `table.filter(lambda e:
  e.filter(e.link_id.isin(ids)))` is right; `table.filter(lambda t: t.link_id.isin(ids))` returns a one-column
  table of booleans (probed; the first draft had this bug in its `_rows` helper). A corral `Edit` predicate is the
  other kind: `lambda t: t.link_id.isin(ids)`. `editing.py` has one helper for each (`_where`, `_in`).
- **Honesty note.** Re-probed on 2026-10-10 against Part 2's tip (`7a19a7f`, which contains Part 1 as merged in
  `a042510`); scripts in the scratchpad, not committed:
  - **The corral undo bug is still there.** `apply_edit` + `reverse_edit` on CSV link 27 (`name` is null) leaves
    two copies of link 27 (339 → 340 rows). The same happens through the real `Session.mutate` followed by a
    prototype of `Session.revert` (reverse on a `derived_copy`, swap with `replace_tables`): v0 → v1 → v2, lineage
    `["lanes", "undo: lanes"]`, 340 rows. Task 1 fixes it.
  - **Lazy-table edits** (Leavenworth parquet): `apply_edit` swaps the edited table's expression for an in-memory
    DuckDB table (`Project` → `DatabaseTable`); untouched tables stay lazy. A one-row `update_rows` on `link` took
    0.017 s (0.018 s warm); `reverse_edit` 0.028 s.
  - **What corral accepts silently** (so the planner must refuse it first): `update_rows` with `lanes = 1.5` still
    widens `int64` to `float64`. The other first-draft findings (an unknown key adds a column; a taken `link_id` is
    added twice; text in a float column raises `IbisTypeError`) come from code unchanged since `aedc407`.
  - **Revert through the session prototype** (parquet): a `free_speed` edit and its revert keep 339 rows and the
    dtype; the restored row moves to the end (position 338). A two-table cascade (`lane` then `link` for link 1)
    and its revert go 339/429 → 338/428 → 339/429.
  - **`OutOfSyncWarning`** is still raised when writing an edited network, both a bare `apply_edit`-ed `Network` and
    the handle after `Session.mutate` ("Package source '…' …"). Opened Leavenworth has no `dirty_tracker`, so the
    warning comes from the tables' own dirty flags.
  - **Leavenworth validation:** `Network.validate()` gives 17 issues (16 `structural.missing_optional_resource` info,
    1 `fk.unverifiable` warning), and `run_quality` adds 271 `quality.high_speed_residential` warnings: **288** in all
    (272 warnings, 16 info). All quality issues carry `table="link"`, `column="free_speed"` and a row; link 1 is
    flagged. `Issue` still takes positional `severity, category, code, message` (not keyword-only).
  - **Tasks 3 and 4 re-run.** Their modules and tests, extracted from this plan, pass against Part 2's tip in a
    scratch copy (53 tests and doctests), with Task 1's `affected_rows` and Task 3's `self_refs` shimmed in. Nothing
    they import (`related.py`, `corral.editing`, `select/`) changed since `aedc407`; only `config.py` did (plugin
    settings).
  - **Today, an edit leaves the selection stale:** `Select(link_ids=[1, 2])`, then deleting link 1 through
    `Session.mutate`, leaves `link_ids == [1, 2]` with status `resolved` (R4 fixes it). An utterance selection
    ("Ski Hill Drive", 20 links) round-trips `payload_from_intent` → `intent_from_payload` exactly and re-resolves to
    the same ids; after deleting one of them it re-resolves to 19.
  - **Session state today** has `networks, active, selection, style, plugins`; P2 adds `edits` and `issues`.
  - **Part 1 facts the snippets rely on, read from the code:** `mutate(..., origin=None)` and `_record_outside_action`;
    `_Mutated` / `_Derived` undo records and `_roll_back`; `NetworkHandle.replace_tables` / `restore`;
    `script_imports` builds its header from `CORE_ACTIONS` (hence R6); `test_action_union_and_core_actions_hold_the_same_models_in_order`
    pins the union to `CORE_ACTIONS` (hence R5); `_RESERVED_NAMES` in `plugins/spec.py` is built from `CORE_ACTIONS`,
    so plugins can't name a class `EditCells`. Part 2 facts: `addPanel` adopts an existing `#dock-<id>` pane;
    `badge(ctx)` gets `commandContext` (with `state`); `addLayer` bumps `layerSeq` and lists titled layers under
    Overlays; core layer factories get the whole store state as `ctx.state`.
  - The snippets for Tasks 5–17 were written against that code but **not run**; the plan as a whole has not been
    executed. Expected results say "pass" plus the new test names, not counts. Where a step fails, fix the plan's
    code; don't weaken the test.

## Decisions (technical, made here)

1. **Refuse what storage cannot hold; warn about what the spec says.** The planner (Task 3) coerces each value to
   its column's storage type and refuses one that does not fit (`"fast"` in a float column, `1.5` in an integer
   column), an unknown column, a key column, a column type P2 cannot edit (geometry, binary, dates, times), a
   missing row, and deleting a node a link still uses. Everything else (required, enum, spec type, foreign keys,
   duplicate keys) is an edit warning (Task 4).
   - Coercion: integers take integral numbers or integral text; floats take numbers or numeric text; text takes any
     scalar; booleans take `true/false/1/0/yes/no`; empty text in a non-text column, and `None`, clear the cell.
2. **Key columns are not edited in a cell.** Changing a primary key would orphan every row that points at it. A new
   key enters through `AddRows`, where a clash is an `edit.duplicate_key` warning.
3. **No derived networks for core edits.** A cell edit is immediate and undoable, and a deletion's preview is the
   `delete-plan` dry run (rows per table), so a copy-on-write preview network adds a step without adding
   information. `derive` stays the plugins' tool for previews and scenarios (the cards plugin previews a card on a
   derived network). (`mutate` itself drafts on a `derived_copy` internally; that is not a registered network.)
4. **Every mutation is a pending edit, whatever made it.** The ledger records core edits (`"workbench"`), plugin
   mutations (the plugin id) and Python's (`"python"`) (R3). Undo is LIFO per network and source-checked
   (decision a).
5. **Live checks cover whole touched rows**, not just the edited cells (a row is what the spec constrains), and are
   bounded: at most `MAX_CHECKED_KEYS = 10_000` keys per table; beyond that the Edits panel says the live check was
   cut short and suggests Run validation.
6. **Deletion cascades through the spec's foreign keys**, recursively (link → lane → `lane_tod`), never into `link`
   or `node` (a node a link uses is refused). Self-references (`link.parent_link_id`) are not followed; rows that
   pointed at a deleted row are re-checked, so they surface as `edit.fk_missing`. Orphaned `geometry` rows stay, as
   Wrangler's `clean_shapes: false` does.
7. **The selection payload carries its ProjectCard facility form.** `selection_payload` adds
   `projectcard: {picked, resolved, query}` (both `to_projectcard` forms) for a resolved selection, so
   `host.selection` exposes it with no new Host method (the plugins design: core owns the facility form).
8. **Job outcomes commit themselves:** `_Loaded` / `_Validated` / `_Saved` each have `commit(session) -> dict`, run
   inside `Session._commit`'s one critical section.
9. **Issue numbers** are positions in the stored report (`i`). Markers and pages refer to them. A new run replaces
   the set.
10. **Bounds:**
    - `/issues` pages hold at most 500;
    - `/issues/markers` returns at most `MAX_MARKERS = 50_000` located markers (`truncated` beyond that), plus a
      per-record index of issue numbers for row marks and the "This record" filter;
    - `EditCells` / `DeleteRows` take at most `MAX_EDIT_IDS = 10_000` ids, `AddRows` at most 10 000 rows.
11. **Export report refuses a stale set** (409, "re-run validation, then export"). Positions in the report are only
    valid at the version it ran on.
12. **Rule config keys are rule codes** (`validation.rules["quality.high_speed_residential"]`).
    - `RuleSettings.severity_override` becomes `Literal["error", "warning", "info"] | None`, so a typo fails at
      settings load, not mid-run.
    - Codes not registered are reported as `unknown_rules` in the run result.
13. **An edit keeps the view:** `linking.netChange(prev, next)` → `same | edited | switched`. Only `switched` resets
    focus, highlights and the table. `edited` refreshes rail counts, rows, related records, details, issues and
    edits in place.
14. **Issue markers are a core layer with an Overlays switch** (R7): `addLayer(CORE, "roadway", "issues", …,
    {order: 450, title: "Issues"})`, between the highlights (400) and the focus (500). Hiding it is `hiddenLayers`,
    per tab and not recorded, like the focus.
15. **The selection follows an edit** (R4; replaces the first draft's "a deletion clears the selection").
16. **Saving with open warnings needs `accept_warnings=True`.** The flag is recorded, so a replayed save makes the
    same choice. A save that started at version *v* marks the ledger saved only if the network is still at *v* when
    the copy lands.

## Scope notes

- **In P2:**
  - the corral undo fix;
  - `to_projectcard` `ignore_missing`, and the facility form on the selection payload;
  - edit planning, live checks, the pending-edits ledger, `Session.revert` / `undo_last`, the selection rule,
    Host 1.2;
  - `RunValidation`, `EditCells`, `DeleteRows`, `AddRows`, `UndoEdit`, `SaveNetwork`;
  - issues, markers, report, edits and delete-plan routes;
  - the Issues and Edits dock panels; the issue layer; P2's commands; cell editing; the record and fix editors; the
    dirty badges;
  - docs.
- **Deferred:**
  - redo;
  - a link-drawing UI for additions;
  - editing key columns, geometry, dates and times;
  - transit edits (P6: the Actions take `component` and answer "not yet supported" for `transit`);
  - auto re-validation;
  - reverting anything but the newest pending edit (R1);
  - a corral `update_rows` that runs as an ibis `mutate` against DuckDB without the Arrow round trip (follow-up;
    see Risks).
- **Unchanged:**
  - the P1a wizard and jobs (apart from the `_commit` refactor);
  - the P1b linking routes;
  - Part 2's slots, palette, menus and Settings → Plugins (P2 only registers into them);
  - `map/edits` (the offline report's edit log and `apply_edits`). The Workbench does not import it in P2.

## Moved to the cards plugin

Everything ProjectCard-shaped from the first draft now belongs to the external cards plugin. Its scope, the
decisions the user has made for it, the schema facts and the mapping file are in
[**2026-10-07-cards-plugin-scope.md**](2026-10-07-cards-plugin-scope.md):

| First-draft item | Now |
|---|---|
| `netstead.changes`: `NetworkChange`, `PropertyChange`, `Selection`, `apply_change` / `reverse_change` | cards plugin; lowered onto core edits through `host.plan_*` + `host.mutate` |
| `DraftCard`, `ChangeLog` (commit, describe), `.yml` export and import, `read_card` | cards plugin (plugin state, `cards.*` Actions) |
| Vendored projectcard schema, `[projectcard]` extra, `card_errors` / `validate_card` | cards plugin, with `projectcard` as a **required** dependency and its own validator |
| `changes/mappings/gmns_to_wrangler.yaml` and `FieldMap` | cards plugin (content preserved in the scope) |
| The Changes drawer tab (card view, commit, export, validate, import) | cards plugin's Edit workspace and dock panel (`wb.registerWorkspace`, `wb.registerPanel`) |
| Importing a `map/edits` edit-log YAML | cards plugin (pending decision) |
| `ApplyChange`, `CommitCard`, `ImportCard` Actions | `cards.*` Actions |

What stays in core because the plugin needs it: `to_projectcard` always writing `ignore_missing` and the facility
form on `host.selection` (Task 2), `host.mutate` recording its plugin as the source (Task 5), `host.undo`,
`host.edit_warnings` and `host.plan_*` (Task 7), and `SaveNetwork` (Task 11).

### Task 0: Branch and baseline

**Files:** none.

- [ ] **Step 1: Check that Parts 1 and 2 are in the base**

```bash
git fetch origin
git log origin/main --oneline | grep -i "plugins, Part 1" | head -1   # a042510 (#222)
# Part 2 (#223) merged? Then start from main; otherwise from Part 2's tip.
git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/feat/workbench-plugins-p2 origin/main && BASE=origin/main || BASE=origin/feat/workbench-plugins-p2
echo "$BASE"
git show "$BASE":packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/plugins/spec.py | grep -n 'HOST_API = '
git show "$BASE":packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/session.py | grep -n "def mutate\|def derive\|class _Mutated\|def _record_outside_action"
git show "$BASE":packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/workspaces.js | grep -n "export function addPanel\|export function showPanel"
git show "$BASE":packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/map.js | grep -n "export function addLayer"
```

Expected: `HOST_API = "1.1"`; `mutate(self, net_id, edits, *, note, origin=None)`, `derive`, `_Mutated` and
`_record_outside_action` in `session.py`; `addPanel`, `showPanel` and `addLayer` exported. If Part 2 is missing,
stop: P2's front end registers into its slots (decision d).

- [ ] **Step 2: Cut the branch**

```bash
git checkout -b feat/workbench-p2-impl "$BASE"
uv sync --all-packages --all-extras
```

- [ ] **Step 3: Record the baseline**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q`
Expected: all pass. Record the count in the PR description. Later tasks only add tests, except these edits to
existing expectations: Task 7 (`HOST_API` 1.1 → 1.2 in two tests), Task 8 (one script-imports test grows a case) and
Task 9 (the settings notes in `test_workbench_session.py`).

No commit.

### Task 1: corral: undo restores rows that contain nulls; `affected_rows`

`_reverse_add_rows` and `_reverse_update_rows` find "the rows this edit touched" with an anti-join on every shared
or untouched column, using `=`. `NULL = NULL` is unknown, so a row with any null never matches. Undoing an edit to
such a row then leaves both the edited copy *and* the restored one (probed on `main`: CSV link 27, 339 → 340 rows).

The live checks (Task 4) also need to know which rows an applied edit touched. That lives in the edit's rollback
blob, whose shape is corral's business, so corral gets a small public reader for it: `affected_rows`.

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/corral/corral/editing/apply.py`, `packages/corral/corral/editing/__init__.py`
- Test: `packages/corral/tests/editing/test_editing.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `packages/corral/tests/editing/test_editing.py`. Change the `from corral.editing.apply import apply_edit`
line to `from corral.editing.apply import affected_rows, apply_edit, reverse_edit`.

```python
def _with_nulls() -> Package:
    e = IbisEngine()
    rows = [{"id": 1, "name": "a", "v": 1.0}, {"id": 2, "name": None, "v": 2.0}, {"id": 3, "name": "c", "v": 3.0}]
    return Package.from_tables({"x": Table(name="x", expr=e.from_records(rows), engine=e)})


def _rows(pkg: Package) -> list[dict]:
    return sorted(pkg.tables["x"].expr.to_pyarrow().to_pylist(), key=lambda r: r["id"])


def test_reverse_update_restores_a_row_whose_other_columns_hold_null() -> None:
    pkg = _with_nulls()
    before = _rows(pkg)
    r = apply_edit(pkg, Edit(op="update_rows", table="x", payload={"predicate": lambda t: t.id == 2, "set": {"v": 9.0}}))
    reverse_edit(pkg, r)
    assert _rows(pkg) == before  # not two copies of id 2


def test_reverse_add_removes_an_added_row_that_holds_null() -> None:
    pkg = _with_nulls()
    before = _rows(pkg)
    r = apply_edit(pkg, Edit(op="add_rows", table="x", payload={"rows": [{"id": 4, "name": None, "v": 4.0}]}))
    reverse_edit(pkg, r)
    assert _rows(pkg) == before


def test_affected_rows_reads_each_op() -> None:
    pkg = _with_nulls()
    added = apply_edit(pkg, Edit(op="add_rows", table="x", payload={"rows": [{"id": 4, "name": "d", "v": 4.0}]}))
    changed = apply_edit(pkg, Edit(op="update_rows", table="x", payload={"predicate": lambda t: t.id == 1, "set": {"v": 5.0}}))
    removed = apply_edit(pkg, Edit(op="delete_rows", table="x", payload={"predicate": lambda t: t.id == 3}))
    assert [r["id"] for r in affected_rows(added)] == [4]
    assert affected_rows(changed) == [{"id": 1, "name": "a", "v": 1.0}]  # the values before the edit
    assert [r["id"] for r in affected_rows(removed)] == [3]
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to confirm they fail**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/corral/tests/editing/test_editing.py -q -k "null or affected"`
Expected: FAIL at import (`affected_rows`). With the import removed, the two null tests FAIL: the update test finds
id 2 twice, and the add test still finds id 4.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `packages/corral/corral/editing/apply.py`, add after `_concat_arrow`:

```python
def _null_safe(left: ibis.Table, right: ibis.Table, columns: list[str]) -> list[Any]:
    """Join predicates that also match NULL to NULL (``=`` never does, so a row holding a null would never match).

    ``right`` is cast to ``left``'s types: a column that is all null in the recorded rows arrives typed ``null``.
    """
    return [left[c].identical_to(right[c].cast(left[c].type())) for c in columns]
```

In `_reverse_add_rows`, replace

```python
    return ibis.memtable(current).anti_join(ibis.memtable(added_arrow), predicates=join_cols).to_pyarrow()
```

with

```python
    left, right = ibis.memtable(current), ibis.memtable(added_arrow)
    return left.anti_join(right, predicates=_null_safe(left, right, join_cols)).to_pyarrow()
```

In `_reverse_update_rows`, replace

```python
    kept = ibis.memtable(current).anti_join(ibis.memtable(original_arrow), predicates=identity_cols).to_pyarrow()
```

with

```python
    left, right = ibis.memtable(current), ibis.memtable(original_arrow)
    kept = left.anti_join(right, predicates=_null_safe(left, right, identity_cols)).to_pyarrow()
```

Add one sentence to both docstrings: `Columns are compared null-safely (NULL matches NULL).`

Then add, after `reverse_edit`:

```python
def affected_rows(result: EditResult) -> list[dict]:
    """The rows an applied edit added, changed (as they were *before* the edit) or removed.

    Read from the edit's rollback data, so callers never interpret that blob themselves. Empty for
    ``replace_table`` (every row) and for an edit that matched nothing.

    Examples:
        >>> from corral.dataset import Package, Table
        >>> from corral.editing import Edit
        >>> from corral.engines.ibis_engine import IbisEngine
        >>> e = IbisEngine()
        >>> pkg = Package.from_tables({"x": Table(name="x", expr=e.from_records([{"a": 1}]), engine=e)})
        >>> affected_rows(apply_edit(pkg, Edit(op="add_rows", table="x", payload={"rows": [{"a": 2}]})))
        [{'a': 2}]
    """
    data = result.rollback_data or {}
    for key in ("added_rows", "original_rows", "deleted_rows"):
        if key in data:
            return list(data[key] or [])
    return []
```

In `packages/corral/corral/editing/__init__.py`, add `from .apply import affected_rows`, add `"affected_rows"` to
`__all__` (sorted), and add one bullet to the module docstring's public surface:
`* :func:`affected_rows` — the rows an applied edit touched.`

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the editing tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/corral/tests/editing -q`
Expected: all pass, including the three new tests and the existing `test_leavenworth_round_trip`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair.
Expected: all pass. The `affected_rows` doctest runs here.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/corral/corral/editing/apply.py packages/corral/corral/editing/__init__.py packages/corral/tests/editing/test_editing.py
git commit -m "fix(corral): undo restores rows that hold nulls (null-safe reverse joins); affected_rows"
```

### Task 2: The selection's ProjectCard facility form (`ignore_missing`, `host.selection`)

The plugins design gives the facility form to core: `host.selection` exposes the selection as a ProjectCard
facility, built by `select/emit.to_projectcard`. Two gaps today:
- ProjectCard's `select_links` marks `ignore_missing` as **required**, and `_query_links` writes it only when it is
  false, so every card built from a default selection fails the schema. The resolved form never writes it.
- The selection payload (what `host.selection` copies: `Session.selection_copy`) carries only the GMNS fragment.

Which `ignore_missing` value a *card* should carry for a click-pick is the cards plugin's decision (pending, see
[the scope](2026-10-07-cards-plugin-scope.md)). Core writes the intent's value (default `true`, Wrangler's default)
and says whether the selection was picked by id, so the plugin can apply its own rule.

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/select/emit.py`, `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/selection.py`
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_select_emit.py`, `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py`,
  `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `packages/netstead/tests/test_select_emit.py`:

```python
def test_projectcard_links_always_carry_ignore_missing():
    # The ProjectCard schema requires it on every links selector (select_links.json "required").
    assert to_projectcard(_resolved())["links"]["ignore_missing"] is True
    page = SelectionIntent(facility=Facility(name=["Page Road"]))
    assert to_projectcard(_resolved_result(page), form="query")["links"]["ignore_missing"] is True
    strict = SelectionIntent(facility=Facility(name=["Page Road"]), ignore_missing=False)
    assert to_projectcard(_resolved_result(strict), form="query")["links"]["ignore_missing"] is False
    assert to_projectcard(_resolved_result(strict))["links"]["ignore_missing"] is False
```

Append to `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py`:

```python
def test_a_selection_carries_its_projectcard_facility(opened):
    first = int(opened.registry.get("rdu-i40").links_df()["link_id"].iloc[0])
    sel = opened.dispatch(Select(link_ids=[first]))
    assert sel["projectcard"]["picked"] is True
    assert sel["projectcard"]["resolved"] == {"links": {"model_link_id": [first], "ignore_missing": True}}
    assert sel["projectcard"]["query"]["links"]["model_link_id"] == [first]
    json.dumps(sel)  # plain JSON: no numpy scalars


def test_an_unparsed_selection_has_no_facility(opened):
    sel = opened.dispatch(Select(utterance="zzzz not a road"))
    assert sel["status"] != "resolved" and sel["projectcard"] is None
```

(`json` and `Select` are already imported there; add them if not.) The `StubParser` gives a `not_found` or
unparsed result for that utterance; either way the facility is `None`.

Append to `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py` (it already defines `make_session` and `make_hello`):

```python
def test_host_selection_exposes_the_facility_form(make_session, rdu_source):
    from netstead.workbench.actions import OpenNetwork, Select

    session = make_session(make_hello())
    session.dispatch(OpenNetwork(source=rdu_source))
    first = int(session.registry.get("rdu-i40").links_df()["link_id"].iloc[0])
    session.dispatch(Select(link_ids=[first]))
    facility = session._hosts["hello"].selection["projectcard"]
    assert facility["picked"] is True and facility["resolved"]["links"]["model_link_id"] == [first]
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to confirm they fail**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_select_emit.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py -q -k "ignore_missing or facility"`
Expected: FAIL: `KeyError: 'ignore_missing'` and `KeyError: 'projectcard'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `to_projectcard` (`select/emit.py`), add this after the `if form == "query": … else: …` block and before the
`from_match` lines:

```python
    # ProjectCard's select_links requires the flag even at its default (the GMNS fragment omits a default true).
    pc["links"]["ignore_missing"] = result.intent.ignore_missing
```

Add to its docstring: `` ``links.ignore_missing`` is always written: the ProjectCard schema requires it.``

In `workbench/selection.py`:
- add `import json` and `from netstead.select.emit import to_fragment, to_projectcard` (extend the existing import);
- add this helper before `selection_payload`:

```python
def facility_forms(result: Any) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """A resolved selection as ProjectCard facility objects, for plugins (``host.selection["projectcard"]``).

    ``resolved`` lists the link ids (``model_link_id``); ``query`` is the re-resolvable selector (name, ref, ...);
    ``picked`` says the selection was made by id (a click or "Set as selection"), not by a query.
    """
    forms = {
        "picked": bool(result.intent.link_ids),
        "resolved": to_projectcard(result),
        "query": to_projectcard(result, form="query"),
    }
    return json.loads(json.dumps(forms, default=json_scalar))  # numpy ids -> plain JSON
```

- in `selection_payload`'s returned dict, after `"fragment"`, add
  `"projectcard": facility_forms(result) if result.status == "resolved" else None,`;
- in `unparsed_payload`'s returned dict, after `"fragment"`, add `"projectcard": None,`;
- add `"facility_forms"` to `__all__`, and to `selection_payload`'s docstring: "``projectcard`` is the
  :func:`facility_forms` of a resolved selection (``None`` otherwise)."

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the selection and session tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_select_emit.py packages/netstead/tests/test_select_cli.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py -q`
Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 5: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/select/emit.py packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/selection.py packages/netstead/tests/test_select_emit.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py
git commit -m "feat(select): ProjectCard selectors always carry ignore_missing; host.selection carries the facility form"

### Task 3: Edit planning: requests become corral edits (`workbench/editing.py`)

Pure functions: read the network, return an `EditPlan`, never mutate. `Session.mutate` (Task 5) applies the plan.
The planner refuses only what the storage cannot hold (Decision 1); spec problems are Task 4's warnings.

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/editing.py`
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/related.py` (`foreign_keys(..., self_refs=...)`)
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_editing.py`, `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_related.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Create `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_editing.py`:

```python
"""Edit planning: requests become corral edits; only what the storage cannot hold is refused."""

If `DataPackage` needs more required fields than `name` and `resources`, pass what its model asks for; the

Nothing here mutates. Each ``plan_*`` reads the network and returns an :class:`EditPlan` whose ``edits``
:meth:`~netstead.workbench.session.Session.mutate` applies all-or-nothing. A plan refuses (raises
:class:`EditRefused`) only what the network cannot hold:

* a value its column's storage type cannot hold: ``"fast"`` in a float column, or ``1.5`` in an integer
  column, which corral would otherwise silently widen to float;
* a column the table does not have (corral would add it), a key column, or a column whose type P2 cannot
  edit (geometry, binary, dates, times);
* a missing row, and deleting a node that a link still starts or ends at.

What the *spec* says about a value (required, enum, type, foreign keys, duplicate keys) is a warning, never
a refusal: see :mod:`netstead.workbench.editcheck`. Two kinds of callable appear below: a corral ``Edit``
predicate maps a table to a boolean column (:func:`_in`); a corral ``Table.filter`` argument maps a table
expression to a filtered one (:func:`_where`).

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_editing.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_related.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_related_routes.py -q`
Expected: all pass. (The Task 3 code ran as a prototype against Leavenworth on `main`; see the honesty note.)

- [ ] **Step 6: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass; the two doctests run.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash

```python
"""Live checks for edited rows: what the spec says about the values an edit left behind (warn, never block).

After every mutation the session re-checks the rows its pending edits have touched, by primary key:

* ``edit.required_empty``: a required field is empty;
* ``edit.type``: a value the column stores but the spec's type cannot hold (``2.5`` for an ``integer``
  field whose column was widened to float; text in a ``number`` field stored as text);
* ``edit.enum``: a value outside the field's ``enum``;
* ``edit.fk_missing``: a foreign-key value the referenced table does not have (self-references included);
* ``edit.duplicate_key``: another row has the same primary key.

Each check reads only the touched rows (an ibis ``IN`` filter) and the referenced keys it needs, so it is
bounded by the edit, not by the network; at most :data:`MAX_CHECKED_KEYS` keys per table are checked. A
whole row is checked, not just the edited cells: a row is what the spec constrains.

If ruff flags the private import, make it public there as `table_schemas` (keeping `_schemas` as an alias).

### Task 5: The pending-edit ledger, live re-checks, and `Session.revert` / `undo_last`

Part 1's `Session.mutate` (as built) applies corral edits to a `derived_copy` draft, swaps the changed tables in with
`NetworkHandle.replace_tables` (bumping the version), appends the lineage note, and then either publishes `state`
(inside an Action, after pushing a `_Mutated` undo record) or records a non-replayable `<origin>.mutate` entry
(outside one). This task makes every mutation a `PendingEdit` in the network's `EditLedger`, re-runs the live checks
over every key the ledger has touched, and adds the mirror operation, `Session.revert`, with `undo_last` on top
(R1–R3). The ledger joins Part 1's rollback through a snapshot undo record, `_LedgerMark`.

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/ledger.py`
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/session.py`
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py` (new)

`replace(e)` copies each entry so a later `mark_saved` on the live ledger can't change the snapshot; the results
lists are shared (they are never mutated).

- [ ] **Step 4: The session**

In `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/session.py`:

1. Imports: change `from corral.editing.apply import apply_edit` to `from corral.editing.apply import apply_edit,
   reverse_edit`, and add `from .editcheck import CheckResult, check_rows, touched_keys`,
   `from .editing import table_keys`, `from .ledger import CORE_SOURCE, PYTHON_SOURCE, EditLedger, PendingEdit`.
2. After the `_Derived` dataclass, add the ledger's undo record:

```python
@dataclass
class _LedgerMark:
    """Undo record for a change to one network's pending-edit ledger inside an Action: the ledger before it."""

    net_id: str
    before: EditLedger | None  # a snapshot (``EditLedger.copy``); ``None``: the network had no ledger

    def undo(self, session: Session) -> None:
        if self.before is None:
            session.edits.pop(self.net_id, None)
        else:
            session.edits[self.net_id] = self.before
```

   and widen the annotation in `__init__`: `self._undo: list[_Mutated | _Derived | _LedgerMark] = []`.
3. In `__init__`, after `self.history`: `self.edits: dict[str, EditLedger] = {}  # net_id -> its pending edits`.
4. Replace `mutate` (keep its first paragraph; the body moves into `_swap` / `_settle`), and add `revert`,
   `undo_last` and `edit_check` after it:

```python
    def mutate(
        self,
        net_id: str | None,
        edits: Sequence[Edit],
        *,
        note: str,
        origin: str | None = None,
        recheck: Mapping[str, Iterable[Any]] | None = None,
    ) -> list[EditResult]:
        """Apply corral ``edits`` to a network's roadway, in order and all-or-nothing; return their results.

        The edits run on a copy-on-write draft of the roadway, so the network itself never holds a
        half-applied state: a failing edit discards the draft and re-raises, leaving the tables, their
        sync stamps, the caches and the pending edits as they were. On success the changed tables are
        swapped in at once, the ``version`` is bumped (dropping caches), ``note`` is appended to the
        lineage, and the change becomes a :class:`~netstead.workbench.ledger.PendingEdit` whose source is
        ``origin`` (a plugin id), ``"workbench"`` (inside a core Action) or ``"python"`` (outside any
        Action). The live checks then re-run over every key the network's pending edits touched (``recheck``
        adds keys beyond the rows these edits touched), and ``state`` is published. Inside an Action, all of
        it is undone if that Action (or one it is nested in) fails. Outside any Action nothing would record
        it, so it gets a history entry of its own, ``<origin>.mutate``, whose ``python`` is a comment: it is
        visible but not replayable. ``origin`` (default ``"python"`` there) also prefixes the lineage note.

5. Add the private helpers next to `_record_outside_action`:

        """Swap ``draft``'s tables ``names`` into ``handle`` in one step: bump the version, extend the lineage.

        changed = {name: (draft.tables[name].expr, draft.tables[name].dirty) for name in names}
        if self._running:
            tracker = roadway.dirty_tracker
            self._undo.append(
                _Mutated(
                    handle,
                    tables={name: (roadway.tables[name].expr, roadway.tables[name].dirty) for name in changed},
                    stamps={name: tracker.get_table_stamp(name) for name in changed} if tracker else {},

        if ledger is None:
            ledger = self.edits[net_id] = EditLedger()
        return ledger

    def _source(self, origin: str | None) -> str:
        """Who a mutation belongs to: its plugin, a core Action (``"workbench"``), or Python outside any Action."""
        return origin or (CORE_SOURCE if self._running else PYTHON_SOURCE)

    def _settle(self, handle: NetworkHandle, note: str, origin: str | None, *, kind: str) -> None:
        """After a swap: re-run the live checks, then publish (inside an Action) or record (outside one)."""
        self._recheck(handle)
        if self._running:
            self.events.publish({"type": "state", "state": self.state()})
        else:
            self._record_outside_action(handle.id, note, origin or PYTHON_SOURCE, kind=kind)

    def _recheck(self, handle: NetworkHandle) -> None:

            return
        try:
            ledger.check = check_rows(handle.roadway, ledger.touched())
        except Exception:  # boundary: a failing check must not undo a good edit; Run validation still works
            logger.exception("live edit check on %s failed", handle.id)
            ledger.check = CheckResult(truncated=True)
```

   `_recheck` assigns `ledger.check` on the live ledger after `_ledger_for` snapshotted it, so a rollback also restores
   the check that matched the old tables.

6. Give `_record_outside_action` a `kind` (the action type's suffix), keeping today's output for `mutate`:

```python
    def _record_outside_action(self, net_id: str, note: str, origin: str, *, kind: str = "mutate") -> None:
        """Record a ``mutate`` or ``revert`` no Action covers, so nothing changes silently (not replayable)."""
        text = " ".join(note.split())  # one line: it becomes a comment in a script
        entry = HistoryEntry(
            seq=len(self.history) + 1,
            action={"type": f"{origin}.{kind}", "net_id": net_id, "note": text},
            ...  # the rest unchanged
```

7. Add a module-level helper next to `_mark_rolled_back`:

```python
def _same_results(given: Sequence[EditResult], held: Sequence[EditResult]) -> bool:
    """Whether ``given`` are exactly the ``EditResult`` objects a pending edit holds (identity, in order)."""
    return len(given) == len(held) and all(a is b for a, b in zip(given, held, strict=True))
```

8. In `state()`, add `"edits": {nid: ledger.summary() for nid, ledger in self.edits.items()},`.
9. In `_do_close_network`, after the examples line: `self.edits.pop(action.net_id, None)`.
10. Update the module docstring's first paragraph: replace "Network *edits* are not actions here yet: in P2 they
    become ProjectCard-shaped ``NetworkChange`` objects." with "Network edits are Actions too (``EditCells``,
    ``DeleteRows``, ``AddRows``, ``UndoEdit``); each one's mutation is a pending edit (see :mod:`.ledger`)."

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py -q`
Expected: all pass. Part 1's `test_mutate_*`, `test_a_handler_that_mutates_then_fails_is_rolled_back`,
`test_a_rolled_back_mutate_restores_the_sync_stamp`, `test_a_job_mutates_without_deadlock_and_is_recorded` and
`test_a_python_mutate_outside_an_action_is_recorded` still pass: `_swap` is the old body, and `kind` defaults to
`"mutate"`.

- [ ] **Step 6: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/ledger.py packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/session.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py
git commit -m "feat(workbench): every mutation is a pending edit with live re-checks; Session.revert and undo_last"
```

### Task 6: The selection follows an edit

R4: after a `mutate` or `revert` on the selected network, a query selection is resolved again, and an id selection
keeps its ids minus the links that are gone. The selection payload keeps a query's parsed intent (`intent`, the tool
arguments `payload_from_intent` writes) so it can be resolved again without the language model.

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/selection.py`, `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/session.py`
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py` (add `Select` to the actions import, and
`from netstead.workbench.editing import plan_delete`):

```python
def test_an_id_selection_drops_deleted_links(session):
    session.dispatch(Select(link_ids=[1, 2]))
    assert session.selection["intent"] is None  # made by ids
    mutate(session, plan_delete(handle(session).roadway, "link", [1]))
    assert session.selection["link_ids"] == [2] and session.selection["status"] == "resolved"
    mutate(session, plan_delete(handle(session).roadway, "link", [2]))
    assert session.selection is None  # nothing left to select


def test_an_id_selection_survives_an_unrelated_edit_unchanged(session):
    session.dispatch(Select(link_ids=[1, 2]))
    before = session.selection
    mutate(session, plan_update(handle(session).roadway, "link", [3], {"lanes": 2}))
    assert session.selection is before


def test_a_query_selection_is_resolved_again(session):
    sel = session.dispatch(Select(utterance="Ski Hill Drive"))
    assert sel["status"] == "resolved" and len(sel["link_ids"]) == 20 and sel["intent"] is not None
    gone = sel["link_ids"][0]
    mutate(session, plan_delete(handle(session).roadway, "link", [gone]))
    assert len(session.selection["link_ids"]) == 19 and gone not in session.selection["link_ids"]
    assert session.selection["utterance"] == "Ski Hill Drive"
    session.undo_last("leavenworth", source="python")
    assert len(session.selection["link_ids"]) == 20  # the revert brings the link back into the query's answer


def test_a_failed_action_keeps_the_old_selection(tmp_path, isolated_env):
    plugin = WorkbenchPlugin(
        id="scribble", name="Scribble", version="0", requires_api=HOST_API, actions=(ActionSpec(Scribble, _scribble),)
    )
    s = Session(project_dir=tmp_path, environ=isolated_env, parser=StubParser(), plugins=[plugin])
    s.dispatch(OpenNetwork(source=SRC))
    s.dispatch(Select(link_ids=[1, 2]))
    before = s.selection
    assert not s.dispatch_recorded(Scribble(fail=True)).ok
    assert s.selection is before  # Part 1's rollback restores the view
```

"Ski Hill Drive" is the most common name in Leavenworth (20 links), and the `StubParser` resolves a bare street name
(probed; see the honesty note).

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to confirm they fail**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py -q -k selection`
Expected: FAIL: `KeyError: 'intent'`, then the stale `link_ids`.

- [ ] **Step 3: The payload keeps a query's intent**

In `workbench/selection.py`:
- add `from netstead.select.parse import payload_from_intent`;
- in `selection_payload`'s returned dict, after `"utterance"`, add
  `"intent": payload_from_intent(result.intent) if utterance is not None else None,`;
- in `unparsed_payload`'s returned dict, after `"utterance"`, add `"intent": None,`;
- add to `selection_payload`'s docstring: "``intent`` is a query's parsed intent as tool arguments
  (:func:`~netstead.select.parse.payload_from_intent`), so an edit can resolve it again; ``None`` for a selection
  made by ids."

- [ ] **Step 4: The rule**

In `session.py`:
- import `from netstead.select.errors import IntentError`, `from netstead.select.parse import intent_from_payload`
  (extend the existing `netstead.select.parse` import) and `from netstead.viz.styling import json_scalar` (extend the
  existing `styleable_columns` import);
- in `_settle`, call `self._refresh_selection(handle)` right after `self._recheck(handle)`;
- add after `_recheck`:

```python
    def _refresh_selection(self, handle: NetworkHandle) -> None:
        """Keep the shared selection true to an edited network (call with the lock held, after a swap).

        A selection made by a query (its payload keeps the parsed ``intent``) is resolved again; one made
        by ids keeps them, minus the links that no longer exist, and is cleared when none is left. It is
        deterministic, so a replayed session agrees; a failed Action restores the old one (``_roll_back``).
        """
        sel = self.selection
        if not sel or sel["net_id"] != handle.id or sel["component"] != "roadway":
            return
        links, nodes = handle.links_df(), handle.nodes_df()
        if sel.get("intent") is not None:
            try:
                intent = intent_from_payload(sel["intent"], sel["utterance"] or "")
            except IntentError:  # cannot happen for a payload we wrote; keep the ids rule rather than fail an edit
                logger.exception("could not re-read the selection's intent on %s", handle.id)
            else:
                result = resolve_frames(intent, links, nodes)
                self.selection = selection_payload(
                    handle, result, utterance=sel["utterance"], parsed_by=sel["parsed_by"]
                )
                return
        present = {json_scalar(v) for v in links["link_id"]}
        kept = [i for i in sel["link_ids"] if i in present]
        if kept == sel["link_ids"]:
            return
        if not kept:
            self.selection = None
            return
        result = resolve_frames(SelectionIntent(link_ids=kept), links, nodes)
        self.selection = selection_payload(handle, result)
```

The re-resolution reads `links_df()` for the new version, which the map buffer needs anyway (it is cached per
version).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py packages/netstead/tests/test_select_cli.py -q`
Expected: all pass. Existing selection tests that compare whole payloads gain the `intent` key; if one compares a
payload dict exactly, add `"intent": None` (ids) or the expected intent there.

- [ ] **Step 6: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

### Task 7: Host API 1.2: `undo`, `edit_warnings`, `plan_*`

`host.mutate` already passes `origin=self.plugin_id` (Part 1), so a plugin's mutation is a pending edit with its id as
the source (Task 5). This task adds what the cards plugin needs to lower a change onto core's rules and undo it.

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/plugins/host.py`, `plugins/spec.py`, `plugins/__init__.py`
- Modify: `packages/netstead/docs/cookbook/workbench-plugins.md`
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py`, `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugin_routes.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py`:

```python
class Retag(BaseAction):
    type: Literal["tagger.retag"] = "tagger.retag"
    mutates: ClassVar[bool] = True
    link_id: int


def test_host_1_2_plans_mutates_reports_and_undoes(make_session):
    from netstead.fixtures import leavenworth
    from netstead.workbench.actions import OpenNetwork
    from netstead.workbench.plugins import EditRefused

    def retag(host, action: Retag) -> list[str]:
        plan = host.plan_update(None, "link", [action.link_id], {"from_node_id": 424242})
        host.mutate(None, plan.edits, note=plan.summary)
        return [w["code"] for w in host.edit_warnings()]

    tagger = WorkbenchPlugin(
        id="tagger", name="Tagger", version="0.1", requires_api="1.2", actions=(ActionSpec(Retag, retag),)
    )
    session = make_session(tagger)
    session.dispatch(OpenNetwork(source=str(leavenworth.parquet_dir())))
    assert session.dispatch(Retag(link_id=1)) == ["edit.fk_missing"]
    assert session.edits["leavenworth"].last().source == "tagger"
    host = session._hosts["tagger"]
    assert host.undo()["source"] == "tagger" and host.edit_warnings() == []
    assert session.history[-1].action["type"] == "tagger.revert"  # outside an Action: recorded, not replayable
    with pytest.raises(EditRefused, match="does not fit"):
        host.plan_update(None, "link", [1], {"lanes": 1.5})


def test_host_undo_refuses_core_s_change(make_session):
    from netstead.fixtures import leavenworth
    from netstead.workbench.actions import OpenNetwork
    from netstead.workbench.editing import plan_update

    session = make_session(make_hello())
    session.dispatch(OpenNetwork(source=str(leavenworth.parquet_dir())))
    plan = plan_update(session.network().roadway, "link", [1], {"lanes": 2})
    session.mutate(None, plan.edits, note=plan.summary)  # Python's change, not hello's
    with pytest.raises(ActionError, match="made by python"):
        session._hosts["hello"].undo()
```

In the same file, change `test_a_plugin_built_for_api_1_0_installs_on_this_host`'s first assertion to
`assert HOST_API == "1.2"` and its docstring to "… on 1.2." In `test_workbench_plugin_routes.py`, rename
`test_plugins_report_host_api_1_1` to `test_plugins_report_host_api_1_2` and expect `"1.2"`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to confirm they fail**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugin_routes.py -q -k "host_1_2 or host_undo or api_1_0 or host_api"`
Expected: FAIL: `ImportError: cannot import name 'EditRefused'`, and `HOST_API` is still `"1.1"`; the tagger
plugin is `incompatible` until then.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

In `plugins/spec.py`, set `HOST_API = "1.2"` and add a line to its comment:
`#: 1.2: Host.undo, Host.edit_warnings and Host.plan_update/plan_delete/plan_add; every mutation is a pending edit.`

In `plugins/host.py`:
- import `from ..editing import EditPlan, plan_add, plan_delete, plan_update` outside `TYPE_CHECKING` (`editing.py`
  imports neither the session nor the plugins package, so there is no cycle);
- extend `mutate`'s docstring: "It becomes a pending edit whose source is this plugin: core's Edits panel lists it
  with the plugin's id, and core's Undo never reverses it (use :meth:`undo`)."
- add after `derive`:

```python
    def undo(self, net_id: str | None = None) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Revert this plugin's newest mutation of a network, if it is the network's newest change.

        Raises ``ActionError`` when the newest change came from core, Python or another plugin. Returns the
        undone entry's view (``seq``, ``source``, ``note``, ``version``, ``rows``, ``saved``). Inside an Action
        handler a failure of that Action restores it; elsewhere it is recorded as ``<plugin id>.revert``.
        """
        return self._session.undo_last(net_id, source=self.plugin_id).view()

    def edit_warnings(self, net_id: str | None = None) -> list[dict[str, Any]]:
        """The live edit warnings on a network now, from every source: show them before committing anything."""
        return [w.to_dict() for w in self._session.edit_check(net_id).warnings]

    def plan_update(self, net_id: str | None, table: str, ids: Sequence[Any], values: dict[str, Any]) -> EditPlan:
        """Core's plan for setting cells (raises ``EditRefused`` for what storage cannot hold); apply it with :meth:`mutate`."""
        return plan_update(self.network(net_id).roadway, table, ids, values)

    def plan_delete(self, net_id: str | None, table: str, ids: Sequence[Any]) -> EditPlan:
        """Core's plan for deleting rows and their dependents (``plan.rows`` says what goes)."""
        return plan_delete(self.network(net_id).roadway, table, ids)

    def plan_add(self, net_id: str | None, table: str, rows: Sequence[dict[str, Any]]) -> EditPlan:
        """Core's plan for adding rows."""
        return plan_add(self.network(net_id).roadway, table, rows)
```

A plan reads the network, so apply it before anything else changes the network. Inside one handler that holds (it
runs under the session lock); from a job, plan and `mutate` back to back, and pass `recheck=plan.recheck` only
through core (plugins don't need it: deleted self-references are re-checked by core's own `DeleteRows`).

In `plugins/__init__.py`, add `from ..editing import EditPlan, EditRefused`, and put both names in `__all__`
(sorted). Extend the module docstring: "``EditPlan`` / ``EditRefused`` come from core's edit planner (``host.plan_*``)."

In `packages/netstead/docs/cookbook/workbench-plugins.md`, add a section "Editing networks (API 1.2)": plan with
`host.plan_*`, apply with `host.mutate(net_id, plan.edits, note=plan.summary)`, read `host.edit_warnings()` before
committing anything to disk, and undo your own newest change with `host.undo()`. Say that core lists every plugin
mutation in its Edits panel with the plugin's id and never undoes it, that undo is strict LIFO across sources (core's
Undo and `host.undo` each refuse the other's change, naming who made it), and that a plugin needing 1.2 declares
`requires_api="1.2"`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugin_routes.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py -q`
Expected: all pass. The hello example declares `requires_api=HOST_API`, so it follows the bump.

- [ ] **Step 5: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass (the JS tests inject
`hostApi: "1.1"` as test data and don't read the constant).

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/plugins packages/netstead/docs/cookbook/workbench-plugins.md packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugin_routes.py
git commit -m "feat(workbench): Host API 1.2: host.undo, host.edit_warnings and host.plan_*"
```

### Task 8: Edit Actions: `EditCells`, `DeleteRows`, `AddRows`, `UndoEdit`; the script header stays

Each is a core Action, appended to `CORE_ACTIONS` and to the `Action` union (R5). Its handler plans with Task 3,
applies through `Session.mutate` (Task 5), and returns the plan's summary, the rows it touched, and the live warnings
on those rows. `script_imports` keeps the pre-P2 header line (R6).

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/actions.py`, `session.py`, `__init__.py`
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py`, `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_action_registry.py`

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_action_registry.py -q`
Expected: FAIL with `ImportError: cannot import name 'AddRows'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: The Actions**

In `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/actions.py`, add after `SetSetting`:

```python
#: Ids one ``EditCells`` / ``DeleteRows`` takes, and rows one ``AddRows`` takes.
MAX_EDIT_IDS = 10_000
#: A cell value: ``None`` clears the cell. The session coerces it to the column's storage type.
CellValue = bool | int | float | str | None


class EditCells(BaseAction):
    """Set cells on rows of one table, picked by primary key (``None`` clears a cell).

    Each value is coerced to its column's storage type; one that does not fit is refused, as are key columns
    and unknown columns. What the spec says about the new values (required, type, enum, foreign keys,
    duplicate keys) comes back as ``warnings``: they warn, they never block.
    """

    type: Literal["edit_cells"] = "edit_cells"
    mutates: ClassVar[bool] = True
    net_id: str | None = None
    component: Component = "roadway"

class DeleteRows(BaseAction):
    """Delete rows of one table by key, with every row that depends on them through the spec's foreign keys.

    A link takes its lanes and time-of-day rows with it. A node that a link still uses is refused.

    net_id: str | None = None
    component: Component = "roadway"
    table: str = "link"
    ids: list[int | str] = Field(min_length=1, max_length=MAX_EDIT_IDS)
    note: str | None = Field(default=None, max_length=500)

    net_id: str | None = None
```

`CellValue` lists `bool` first so pydantic's smart union keeps `True` a boolean (it would anyway; the order documents
it).

Append the four classes, in this order, to **both** the `Action` union and `CORE_ACTIONS` (R5). Add them and
`MAX_EDIT_IDS` to `__all__`, and export the four classes from `workbench/__init__.py` (import and `__all__`):
`import_line` writes `from netstead.workbench import EditCells` for a core Action.

Freeze the script header (R6). Replace `script_imports` with:

```python
#: The core Actions on a replayed script's first line, exactly as before P2 added core Actions, so a script that
#: uses only these keeps its header byte for byte. A later core Action gets its own line, like a plugin's.
_SCRIPT_HEADER = ("OpenNetwork", "BuildNetwork", "CloseNetwork", "SetActiveNetwork", "Select", "ClearSelection",
                  "Style", "Navigate", "SetSetting")


def script_imports(lines: Iterable[str]) -> list[str]:
    """The import lines heading a replayed session script, given its entries' :func:`import_line` values.

    The first line is always ``Session`` plus the nine original core Actions from ``netstead.workbench`` (so
    a script using only those is unchanged from before plugins and P2 existed); each other line (a later core
    Action's, a plugin Action's) follows once, in order.

    >>> script_imports(["from netstead.workbench import Select", "from hello import Greet"])[1:]
    ['from hello import Greet']
    >>> script_imports(["from netstead.workbench import EditCells"])[1:]
    ['from netstead.workbench import EditCells']
    """
    covered = {f"from netstead.workbench import {name}" for name in _SCRIPT_HEADER}
    head = ", ".join(["Session", *_SCRIPT_HEADER])
    return [f"from netstead.workbench import {head}", *dict.fromkeys(ln for ln in lines if ln and ln not in covered)]
```

Add a guard comment above `CORE_ACTIONS`: "Append new core Actions at the end, here and in `Action`; never
reorder (`_SCRIPT_HEADER` names the first nine)."

`plugins/spec.py`'s `_RESERVED_NAMES` is built from `CORE_ACTIONS`, so plugins can no longer name a class
`EditCells`, `DeleteRows`, `AddRows` or `UndoEdit` (nor, after Tasks 9 and 11, `RunValidation` or `SaveNetwork`).
That is intended: a script binds those names from `netstead.workbench`.

- [ ] **Step 4: The handlers**

In `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/session.py`:
- imports: add `AddRows, DeleteRows, EditCells, UndoEdit` to the `.actions` import;
  `from corral.editing import EditingError` (extend the `Edit, EditResult` import); `from .editing import EditPlan,
  EditRefused, plan_add, plan_delete, plan_update` (extend Task 5's `table_keys` import);
- add after `_do_set_setting`:

```python
    def _edit_target(self, action: EditCells | DeleteRows | AddRows) -> NetworkHandle:
        if action.component != "roadway":
            raise NotSupportedYet("transit edits arrive with the transit component (phase P6)")
        return self._handle(action.net_id)

    def _apply_plan(self, handle: NetworkHandle, plan: EditPlan, note: str | None) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Apply ``plan`` as one pending edit and describe it, with the live warnings on the rows it touched."""
        text = f"{plan.summary} ({note})" if note else plan.summary
        try:
            self.mutate(handle.id, plan.edits, note=text, recheck=plan.recheck)
        except EditingError as exc:  # corral refused the payload; the draft was discarded, nothing changed
            raise ActionError(f"the edit failed: {exc}") from exc
        ledger = self.edits[handle.id]
        entry = ledger.last()
        return {
            "net_id": handle.id,
            "version": handle.version,
            "summary": plan.summary,
            "rows": dict(plan.rows),
            "keys": list(plan.keys),
            "warnings": [w.to_dict() for w in ledger.check.for_rows(entry.touched)],
            "open_warnings": len(ledger.check.warnings),
        }

    def _do_edit_cells(self, action: EditCells) -> dict[str, Any]:
        handle = self._edit_target(action)
        plan = _planned(lambda: plan_update(handle.roadway, action.table, action.ids, action.values))
        return self._apply_plan(handle, plan, action.note)

    def _do_delete_rows(self, action: DeleteRows) -> dict[str, Any]:
        handle = self._edit_target(action)
        plan = _planned(lambda: plan_delete(handle.roadway, action.table, action.ids))
        return self._apply_plan(handle, plan, action.note)  # the selection follows in mutate (Task 6)

    def _do_add_rows(self, action: AddRows) -> dict[str, Any]:
        handle = self._edit_target(action)
        plan = _planned(lambda: plan_add(handle.roadway, action.table, action.rows))
        return self._apply_plan(handle, plan, action.note)

    def _do_undo_edit(self, action: UndoEdit) -> dict[str, Any]:
        entry = self.undo_last(action.net_id)
        handle = self._handle(action.net_id)
        return {
            "net_id": handle.id,
            "version": handle.version,
            "undone": entry.view(),
            "open_warnings": len(self.edit_check(handle.id).warnings),
        }
```

- add a module-level helper next to `_follows_endpoint`:

```python
def _planned(build: Callable[[], EditPlan]) -> EditPlan:
    """Run an edit planner; its refusal becomes a recorded :class:`ActionError` (nothing changed)."""
    try:
        return build()
    except EditRefused as exc:
        raise ActionError(str(exc)) from exc
```

`_do_*` handlers run under the session lock (`dispatch_recorded`), and `mutate` re-enters it (an `RLock`), so a plan,
its application and the version bump are one step for every reader that takes the lock. Because they run inside an
Action, `mutate` pushes its undo records and publishes `state` instead of writing a `python.mutate` entry, and the
pending edit's source is `"workbench"`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_actions.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_action_registry.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_server.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_plugins.py -q`

### Task 9: `RunValidation`: a background job, with issues located by key and anchor

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/issues.py`
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/config.py` (`RuleSettings.severity_override`)
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/actions.py`, `session.py`, `__init__.py` (the session's job outcomes)
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_issues.py`; modify `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

```

In `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py`, the settings-payload test asserts
`set(p["notes"]) == {"engine", "validation", "credentials"}`. Change it to `{"engine", "credentials"}`: validation
is now used.

If `Issue(...)` takes keyword-only fields, pass `severity=`, `category=`, `code=`, `message=` by name. Its
dataclass order is severity, category, code, message, table, column, row, fix_hint, extra.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to confirm they fail**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_issues.py -q`
Expected: FAIL with `ImportError: cannot import name 'RunValidation'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Settings**

In `packages/netstead/netstead/config.py`, change `RuleSettings.severity_override` to:

```python
    severity_override: Literal["error", "warning", "info"] | None = None
```

Change the `ValidationSettings` docstring to
`"""Per-rule quality configuration, keyed by rule code (e.g. ``quality.high_speed_residential``)."""`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Create `workbench/issues.py`**

```python
"""Validation in the workbench: run the checks, then tie each issue to a record and to a map anchor.

A rule reports a row *position* (``Issue.row``) in the order it read the table (``Table.to_pandas()``), at the
version it ran on. Positions are turned into primary keys here, once, from that same order, so the UI can link
an issue to its row by key and to the map by ``anchor``:

* ``{"link": id}`` / ``{"node": id}``: the record itself, or the link/node a row points at (a lane's ``link_id``);
* ``{"lonlat": [x, y]}``: a rule that reported coordinates (``Issue.extra`` ``lon``/``lat`` or ``x``/``y``);
* ``None``: unlocated (a missing table, a whole-table finding).

The browser places anchors from the network buffer it has already decoded, so no geometry is sent twice.

    return None
```

- [ ] **Step 5: The action**

In `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/actions.py`, add after `Navigate`:

```python
class RunValidation(BaseAction):
    """Validate a network (spec, keys, structure, and the quality rules in Settings → validation) as a background job."""

    type: Literal["run_validation"] = "run_validation"
    runs_as_job: ClassVar[bool] = True
    net_id: str | None = None
    quality: bool = True

    def job_label(self) -> str:
        """``validate <network>``."""
        return f"validate {self.net_id or 'network'}"
```

Append it to the `Action` union and to `CORE_ACTIONS` (R5), after Task 8's four, and add it to `__all__` and
`workbench/__init__.py` (import and `__all__`). A session that runs it gets a
`from netstead.workbench import RunValidation` line after the frozen header (R6).

- [ ] **Step 6: The session: job outcomes commit themselves**

In `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/session.py`:

1. Imports: add `RunValidation` to the `.actions` import, and
   `from .issues import IssueSet, locate_issues, run_validation`.
2. Give `_Loaded` a `commit` method, and add `_Validated` after it:

```python
    def commit(self, session: Session) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Register the network and make it active (called under the session lock)."""
        handle = session.registry.add(self.net, source=self.source, label=self.label, net_id=self.net_id)
        handle.prime(**self.frames)
        session.active = handle.id
        return {"net_id": handle.id, **self.extra}


@dataclass
class _Validated:
    """A validation job's issues, waiting to be stored for the network version they describe."""

    handle: NetworkHandle
    issues: IssueSet

    def commit(self, session: Session) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Store the issue set (called under the session lock); the network may have been edited meanwhile."""
        h = self.handle
        if h.id not in session.registry.ids() or session.registry.get(h.id) is not h:
            raise ActionError(f"network {h.id!r} was closed while it was being validated")
        session.issues[h.id] = self.issues
        return {
            "net_id": h.id,
            "version": self.issues.version,
            "stale": h.version != self.issues.version,
            "counts": self.issues.counts(),
            "unknown_rules": list(self.issues.unknown_rules),
        }
```

3. Replace the body of `Session._commit`: it now commits any outcome. Keep the docstring, and add "The outcome's
   `commit` registers a network, stores issues, …":

```python
        with self._lock:
            result = outcome.commit(self)
            entry = self._record(action, ok=True, result=result, error=None, error_type=None)
            self._committed[ctx.job_id] = entry.seq
        return result
```

   Rename its parameter from `loaded: _Loaded` to `outcome: _Outcome` (Part 1 already typed `action` as
   `BaseAction`). Define, after the outcome classes, `_Outcome = _Loaded | _Validated` (Task 11 adds `_Saved`).
4. In `__init__`, after `self.history`: `self.issues: dict[str, IssueSet] = {}  # net_id -> last validation`.
5. Add the job after `_job_build_network`:

```python
    def _job_run_validation(self, action: RunValidation, ctx: JobContext) -> _Validated:
        with self._lock:
            handle = self._handle(action.net_id)
            version, rules = handle.version, self.settings.validation
        ctx.stage("validate", progress=0.05)
        try:
            report, unknown = run_validation(handle.roadway, rules, quality=action.quality)
            ctx.stage("locate", progress=0.85)
            issues = locate_issues(report, handle.roadway)
        except ActionError:
            raise
        except Exception as exc:  # boundary: a crashing check is a reported failure, with its reason
            logger.exception("workbench validation of %s failed", handle.id)
            raise ActionError(f"validation failed: {type(exc).__name__}: {exc}") from exc
        ctx.stage("store", progress=0.95)  # last cancellation checkpoint
        return _Validated(handle, IssueSet(handle.id, version, issues, report, unknown))

    def issue_set(self, net_id: str) -> IssueSet | None:
        """The last validation of ``net_id`` (``None`` before any)."""
        with self._lock:
            return self.issues.get(net_id)
```

   (`issue_set` is a public method: place it with the other public API methods, after `state`.)
6. In `state()`, add:

```python
                "issues": {
                    nid: {"version": s.version, "stale": s.version != self.registry.get(nid).version, "counts": s.counts()}
                    for nid, s in self.issues.items()
                },
```

7. In `_do_close_network`, after Task 5's `self.edits.pop(...)` line: `self.issues.pop(action.net_id, None)`.
8. In `_SECTION_NOTES`, delete the `"validation"` entry.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_issues.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session_jobs.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_jobs.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_actions.py -q`
Expected: all pass. The `_commit` refactor is covered by the existing open/build job tests.

- [ ] **Step 8: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/config.py packages/netstead/netstead/workbench packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_issues.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py
git commit -m "feat(workbench): RunValidation job; issues located by record key and map anchor"

### Task 11: `SaveNetwork`: write the edited network as a new copy (warnings need confirming)

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/build.py` (`output_path`)
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/actions.py`, `session.py`, `__init__.py`
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing tests**

Append to `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py`. Add `SaveNetwork` to the actions import, and
`from pathlib import Path` and `from netstead import Network` at the top:

```python
def outdir(tmp_path):
    out = tmp_path / "out"
    out.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
    return str(out)


def test_save_writes_a_new_copy_and_never_the_source(session, tmp_path):
    session.dispatch(EditCells(ids=[1], values={"free_speed": 30}))
    result = session.dispatch(SaveNetwork(output_dir=outdir(tmp_path), name="edited", output_format="parquet"))
    assert Path(result["output"]).parent == Path(outdir(tmp_path)) and result["edits_saved"] == 1
    assert result["edited_while_saving"] is False and result["accepted_warnings"] == 0
    assert any("stale" in n for n in result["notes"])  # corral's OutOfSyncWarning: kept as text, not raised
    assert session.state()["edits"]["leavenworth"]["dirty"] is False
    back = Network.from_source(result["output"]).tables["link"].to_pandas()
    assert back.loc[back.link_id == 1, "free_speed"].tolist() == [30.0]
    source = Network.from_source(SRC).tables["link"].to_pandas()
    assert source.loc[source.link_id == 1, "free_speed"].tolist() == [40.0]
    with pytest.raises(ActionError, match="already exists"):
        session.dispatch(SaveNetwork(output_dir=outdir(tmp_path), name="edited", output_format="parquet"))


def test_saving_with_open_warnings_needs_confirmation(session, tmp_path):
    session.dispatch(EditCells(table="node", ids=[1], values={"ctrl_type": "bogus"}))
    with pytest.raises(ActionError, match="1 open edit warning"):
        session.dispatch(SaveNetwork(output_dir=outdir(tmp_path), name="edited", output_format="parquet"))
    assert session.history[-1].result["warnings"][0]["code"] == "edit.enum"
    result = session.dispatch(
        SaveNetwork(output_dir=outdir(tmp_path), name="edited", output_format="parquet", accept_warnings=True)
    )
    assert result["accepted_warnings"] == 1
    assert "accept_warnings=True" in session.history[-1].python  # a replay makes the same choice


def test_save_stays_inside_the_allowed_roots(session):
    with pytest.raises(PathNotAllowed):
        session.dispatch(SaveNetwork(output_dir="/etc", name="x", output_format="parquet"))
```

Add `PathNotAllowed` to the `netstead.workbench.errors` import.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to confirm they fail**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py -q -k save`
Expected: FAIL with `ImportError: cannot import name 'SaveNetwork'`.

- [ ] **Step 3: A shared destination check**

In `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/build.py`, extract the destination check out of `plan_build`:

```python
def output_path(output_dir: str, name: str, output_format: str, settings: Settings, *, what: str = "builds") -> Path:
    """Where ``name`` lands in ``output_dir`` (inside ``io.allowed_roots``); never an existing path.

    Raises:
        PathNotAllowed: ``output_dir`` is outside ``io.allowed_roots``.
        ActionError: the folder does not exist, or the destination already does.
    """
    out_dir = _local(output_dir, "output_dir", settings)
    if not out_dir.is_dir():
        raise ActionError(f"output folder does not exist: {output_dir}")
    suffix = _SUFFIX[output_format]
    dest = out_dir / (name if name.lower().endswith(suffix) else f"{name}{suffix}")
    if dest.exists():
        raise ActionError(f"{dest} already exists; choose another name ({what} never overwrite)")
    return dest
```

Then replace the matching lines in `plan_build` (from `out_dir = _local(...)` through the `dest.exists()` check) with
`dest = output_path(action.output_dir, action.name, action.output_format, settings)`, and add `output_path` to
`build.__all__`.

- [ ] **Step 4: The Action**

In `actions.py`, hoist the build-name pattern next to `_OUTPUT_SUFFIXES`, and factor `BuildNetwork`'s suffix check
into a function both Actions call:

```python
#: A file or folder name: letters, digits, ``_ . -``; no path separator, no leading dot.
_NAME_PATTERN = r"^[A-Za-z0-9](?:[A-Za-z0-9_.-]*[A-Za-z0-9_-])?$"


def _check_name(name: str, output_format: str) -> None:
    suffix = PurePath(name).suffix.lower()
    if suffix in _OUTPUT_SUFFIXES and suffix != f".{output_format}":
        raise ValueError(f"name {name!r} ends in {suffix} but output_format is {output_format!r}")
```

Make `BuildNetwork.name` use `Field(pattern=_NAME_PATTERN, max_length=100)`, and call `_check_name(self.name,
self.output_format)` in its validator in place of the inline check. Then add:

```python
class SaveNetwork(BaseAction):
    """Write the open network, with its edits, as a new copy in ``output_dir``. The source is never written to.

    While the network has open edit warnings the save is refused, listing them, unless ``accept_warnings``.
    """

    type: Literal["save_network"] = "save_network"
    mutates: ClassVar[bool] = True
    runs_as_job: ClassVar[bool] = True
    net_id: str | None = None
    output_dir: str
    output_format: Literal["parquet", "csv", "duckdb", "zip"]
    name: str = Field(pattern=_NAME_PATTERN, max_length=100)
    accept_warnings: bool = False

    @model_validator(mode="after")
    def _name_matches_format(self) -> SaveNetwork:
        _check_name(self.name, self.output_format)
        return self

    def job_label(self) -> str:
        """``save <name>``."""
        return f"save {self.name}"
```

Append it to the `Action` union and to `CORE_ACTIONS` (R5), after `RunValidation`, and add it to `__all__` and
`workbench/__init__.py`.

- [ ] **Step 5: The job**

In `session.py`:
- add `import warnings` and `from corral.dataset.package import OutOfSyncWarning`;
- add `SaveNetwork` to the actions import;
- add the outcome after `_Validated`, and extend the alias to `_Outcome = _Loaded | _Validated | _Saved`:

```python
@dataclass
class _Saved:
    """A save job's output, reported once the copy is in place."""

    handle: NetworkHandle
    version: int
    output: str
    notes: list[str]
    edits: int
    accepted: int

    def commit(self, session: Session) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Mark the pending edits saved, if the network did not change while saving (called under the lock)."""
        edited = self.handle.version != self.version
        ledger = session.edits.get(self.handle.id)
        if ledger is not None and not edited:
            ledger.mark_saved()
        return {
            "net_id": self.handle.id,
            "output": self.output,
            "version": self.version,
            "edited_while_saving": edited,
            "edits_saved": self.edits,
            "accepted_warnings": self.accepted,
            "notes": self.notes,
        }
```

Then the job, after `_job_run_validation`:

```python
    def _job_save_network(self, action: SaveNetwork, ctx: JobContext) -> _Saved:
        with self._lock:
            handle = self._handle(action.net_id)
            version, settings = handle.version, self.settings
            ledger = self.edits.get(handle.id)
            pending = len(ledger.entries) if ledger else 0
            open_warnings = ledger.check.warnings if ledger else ()
        if open_warnings and not action.accept_warnings:
            n = len(open_warnings)
            refused = ActionError(
                f"the network has {n} open edit warning{'s' if n != 1 else ''}; review them in the Issues panel, "
                "then save with accept_warnings=True"
            )
            refused.payload = {"count": n, "warnings": [w.to_dict() for w in open_warnings[:50]]}
            raise refused
        dest = build.output_path(action.output_dir, action.name, action.output_format, settings, what="saves")
        build.remove_stale_partials(dest.parent)
        # Writing an edited network warns OutOfSyncWarning ("... stale table(s) ..."): keep the text for the
        # result instead of letting the warning escape. (catch_warnings is process-global; jobs are few and
        # short, and other warnings keep their configured behaviour.)
        with build.staging(dest) as tmp, warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as caught:
            warnings.simplefilter("always", OutOfSyncWarning)
            build.write_output(handle.roadway, tmp, action.output_format, ctx)
            ctx.stage("save", progress=0.95)  # last cancellation checkpoint
            build.promote(tmp, dest)
        notes = [scrub(str(w.message), limit=None) for w in caught if issubclass(w.category, OutOfSyncWarning)]
        return _Saved(handle, version, str(dest), notes, pending, len(open_warnings))
```

The source in the warning may be a presigned URL, so `scrub` it. The refusal's `payload` reaches the history entry
the way `BuildNetwork`'s estimate does, so the browser can list the warnings it was refused for.

- [ ] **Step 6: Run the tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_session.py -q`
Then the build job tests: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests -q -k "build or wizard or estimate"`.
Expected: all pass. The `plan_build` refactor keeps its messages, because `what` defaults to "builds".

- [ ] **Step 7: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/workbench packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edits.py
git commit -m "feat(workbench): SaveNetwork writes a new copy; open edit warnings need accept_warnings"
```

                "can_undo": bool(last and last.source == CORE_SOURCE),
                "warnings": [w.to_dict() for w in ledger.check.warnings],
            }

    def delete_preview(self, handle: NetworkHandle, table: str, ids: Sequence[Any]) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """What deleting ``ids`` from ``table`` would remove (rows per table), or why it is refused. Changes nothing."""
        with self._lock:
            try:
                plan = plan_delete(handle.roadway, table, ids)
            except EditRefused as exc:
                return {"table": table, "refused": str(exc), "rows": {}, "summary": None}
            return {"table": table, "refused": None, "rows": dict(plan.rows), "summary": plan.summary}
```

`**ledger.summary()` puts `warnings` (a count) in the dict first; the explicit `"warnings"` list after it wins. The
count is still there as `len(warnings)`.

- [ ] **Step 4: Routes**

In `routes/edit.py`:
- add `from pydantic import BaseModel, ConfigDict, Field` and `from ..actions import MAX_EDIT_IDS`;
- add, before `edit_router`:

```python
class DeletePlanQuery(BaseModel):
    """The keys a deletion would start from."""

    model_config = ConfigDict(extra="forbid", hide_input_in_errors=True)
    ids: list[int | str] = Field(min_length=1, max_length=MAX_EDIT_IDS)
```

- add before `return router`:

```python
    @router.get("/edits")
    def edits(net_id: str, component: str) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Pending edits, undo and dirty state, and the live edit warnings (always current, never stale)."""
        return session.edits_payload(network_handle(session, net_id, component))

    @router.post("/table/{table_name}/delete-plan")
    def delete_plan(net_id: str, component: str, table_name: str, q: DeletePlanQuery) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """A dry run of ``DeleteRows``: rows per table that would go, or why the deletion is refused."""
        return session.delete_preview(network_handle(session, net_id, component), table_name, q.ids)
```

Add `"DeletePlanQuery"` to the module's `__all__`.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edit_routes.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_network_routes.py -q`
Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 6: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/workbench packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_edit_routes.py
git commit -m "feat(workbench): edits view and delete-plan dry run routes"
```

### Task 13: Pure front-end rules: `issuelist.js`, `editmodel.js`, and `linking.js` additions

The rules the panels, the layer, the commands and the grid share. Badges read the **server state** (`issues`,
`edits`), so the dock re-evaluates them on every `state` event with no extra wiring (Part 2 Decision 5).

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/issuelist.js`
- Create: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/editmodel.js`
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/linking.js`

- [ ] **Step 2: Run them to confirm they fail**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_js.py -q`
Expected: the new tests FAIL. The modules don't exist yet; `netChange` is not exported; `rowMarks` ignores
`issues` and `warned`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement**

Create `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/issuelist.js`:

```

In `linking.js`:
- add after `pageOffset`:

```js
// What a new decoded-network key ("<id>@<version>") means for the view: "switched" (another network, or none),
// "edited" (the same network at a new version: an edit or an undo), or "same".

  const id = k => (k ? k.slice(0, k.lastIndexOf("@")) : null);
  return prevKey && nextKey && id(prevKey) === id(nextKey) ? "edited" : "switched";
}
```

- change `rowMarks` to accept `issues = 0, warned = false`, and add before its `return`:
  `if (issues) marks.push("iss");` and `if (warned) marks.push("warn");`
- extend its comment: `` `issues`: how many issues the last validation recorded against this record; `warned`: it
  has live edit warnings.``

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_js.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py -q`
Expected: all pass. The existing `test_row_marks` still passes (the new arguments default off).

- [ ] **Step 5: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_js.py
git commit -m "feat(workbench): issue-list, badge and edit rules as unit-tested modules"
```

### Task 14: Issues and Edits dock panels, the edits feed, and an edit keeps the view

Part 2 made the right drawer the dock, with core's Details as its first panel. P2's Issues and Edits register into
it exactly as a plugin panel would (Part 2's "What P2 changes"), in every workspace (R7). Their panes are static
markup, so the static id test sees every element the JS uses; `addPanel` adopts a pane that already exists.

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/index.html`, `app.css`
- Create: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/edits.js` (Task 17 adds the Edits panel's rendering)
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/store.js`, `main.js`, `table.js`
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py`:

```python
def test_issues_and_edits_are_core_dock_panels():
    html = (STATIC_DIR / "index.html").read_text()
    side = html[html.index('<aside id="side">') : html.index("</aside>")]
    order = [side.index(f'id="dock-{p}"') for p in ("details", "issues", "edits")]
    assert order == sorted(order)
    for panel in ("issues", "edits"):
        assert f'data-panel="{panel}"' in side and f'aria-labelledby="dtab-{panel}" hidden' in side
    edits = (JS_DIR / "edits.js").read_text()
    assert 'addPanel(CORE, { id: "issues"' in edits and 'addPanel(CORE, { id: "edits"' in edits
    assert "workspace: ALL_WORKSPACES" in edits
    main = (JS_DIR / "main.js").read_text()
    assert main.index("registerCoreSlots()") < main.index("registerEditPanels()") < main.index("wireWorkspaces(")
    assert "drawerTab" not in (JS_DIR / "store.js").read_text()  # the dock's dockPanel holds the choice
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to confirm it fails**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py -q -k dock_panels`
Expected: FAIL: there is no `#dock-issues`.

- [ ] **Step 3: The panes**

In `index.html`, between the `</section>` that closes `#dock-details` and `</aside>`, add two empty panes (Tasks 15
and 17 fill them):

```html
    <section class="dock-pane" id="dock-issues" data-panel="issues" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="dtab-issues" hidden></section>
    <section class="dock-pane" id="dock-edits" data-panel="edits" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="dtab-edits" hidden></section>
```

Append to `app.css`:

```css
  a.btn { display:inline-block; text-decoration:none; padding:5px 10px; border-radius:8px; font-size:12px;
          border:1px solid var(--edge); color:var(--ink); }
  a.btn.off { opacity:.45; pointer-events:none; }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: Store keys**

In `store.js`, add to the initial state (no `drawerTab`: the dock's `dockPanel` holds the choice; no `showIssues`:
Layers → Overlays hides the issue layer through `hiddenLayers`):

```js
  issues: null,               // /issues/markers for the active network: {net_id, version, markers, records}
  issueFilter: { severity: [], table: "", code: "", located: "", thisRecord: false },
  issueFocus: null,           // the issue number last picked in the list or on the map
  fixTarget: null,            // {table, id, column, note}: what "Fix the picked issue…" edits (an issue or a warning)
  edits: null,                // GET /edits for the active network: pending edits and live edit warnings
```

- [ ] **Step 5: The panels and the edits feed**

Create `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/edits.js`. The Issues panel (warnings), the grid (cell marks)
and the Edits panel all read `store.edits`; this keeps it current, and registers the two panels.

```js
// The Issues and Edits dock panels (registered like a plugin's, in every workspace), and the active network's pending
// edits and live edit warnings (GET /edits), kept in `store.edits`. Task 17 adds the Edits panel's rendering.
import { getJSON, netPath } from "./api.js";
import { toast } from "./dom.js";
import { editsBadge } from "./editmodel.js";
import { issuesBadge } from "./issuelist.js";
import { ALL_WORKSPACES, CORE } from "./slots.js";
import { store } from "./store.js";
import { addPanel } from "./workspaces.js";

let seq = 0, feedKey = null;
const activeId = () => { const s = store.get().server; return s && s.active; };

// Badges read the server state (ctx.state), so the dock refreshes them on every state event.
export function registerEditPanels() {
  addPanel(CORE, { id: "issues", title: "Issues", workspace: ALL_WORKSPACES, order: 10, badge: c => issuesBadge(c.state) });
  addPanel(CORE, { id: "edits", title: "Edits", workspace: ALL_WORKSPACES, order: 20, badge: c => editsBadge(c.state) });
}

export async function loadEdits() {
  const id = activeId(), mine = ++seq;
  if (!id) { store.set({ edits: null }); return; }
  const j = await getJSON(netPath(id, "edits"));
  if (mine === seq && activeId() === id) store.set({ edits: j });
}

// Server state arrived: reload when the active network, its version, or its edit summary moved.
export function onEditsState(server) {
  const id = server.active, h = server.networks.find(n => n.id === id);
  const key = JSON.stringify([id, h && h.version, server.edits && server.edits[id]]);
  if (key === feedKey) return;
  feedKey = key;
  loadEdits().catch(e => toast(e.message));
}
```

With three panels the dock's tab strip now shows (Part 2: it shows with two or more), reading
"Details | Issues ⟨n⟩ | Edits ⟨n⟩ ●".

In `main.js`:
- import `{ onEditsState, registerEditPanels }` from `./edits.js`;
- in `boot()`, call `registerEditPanels();` right after `registerCoreSlots();` (before `wireWorkspaces(...)`);
- add to `wireStore()`: `store.subscribe(["server"], s => onEditsState(s.server));`

- [ ] **Step 6: An edit keeps the view**

In `table.js`, add after `onNetworkChanged`:

```js
// The same network at a new version (an edit or an undo): refresh the rail's row counts and the rows in place,
// keeping the table, page, sort, filters and scope.
export function onNetworkEdited() {
  if (!TBL.loaded) return;
  refreshRail().catch(fail);
  refreshRows();
}

async function refreshRail() {
  const id = activeId();
  if (!id) return;
  const j = await getJSON(netPath(id, "tables"));
  const counts = new Map(j.tables.map(t => [t.name, t.rows]));
  for (const el of document.querySelectorAll(".tbl-item")) {
    const n = counts.get(el.dataset.name), rc = el.querySelector(".rc");
    if (rc && n != null) rc.textContent = n.toLocaleString();
  }
}
```

In `main.js`:
- import `netChange` from `./linking.js` and add `onNetworkEdited` to the `./table.js` import;
- replace

```js
  store.subscribe(["netKey"], () => { cancelRelated(); onNetworkChanged(); store.set({ highlights: new Set(), focus: null, related: null }); clearDetails(); });
```

  with `store.subscribe(["netKey"], s => onNetKey(s.netKey));`;
- add near `onFocus`:

```js
// A newly decoded network. Another network resets the view. The same network at a new version (an edit, an undo)
// keeps focus, highlights, the table and its scope, and refreshes what depends on the data.
let shownKey = null;
function onNetKey(key) {
  const kind = netChange(shownKey, key);
  shownKey = key;
  if (kind === "same") return;
  if (kind === "edited") {
    onNetworkEdited();
    scheduleRelated();
    const f = store.get().focus;
    if (f) showDetails(f.table, f.id);
    return;
  }
  cancelRelated(); onNetworkChanged(); store.set({ highlights: new Set(), focus: null, related: null }); clearDetails();
}
```

`loadActiveNetwork` already re-fits the map only on a switch (`switched`), so an edit keeps the camera too.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run the static and JS tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_js.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_slots_js.py -q`
Expected: all pass. Every new id is in `index.html`, every import resolves, and Part 2's dock tests
(`test_the_drawer_is_the_dock_and_keeps_the_details_content`, `test_core_registers_inspect_and_details_through_the_slots`)
are unchanged.

- [ ] **Step 8: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 9: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py
git commit -m "feat(workbench): Issues and Edits dock panels with badges; an edit keeps focus, highlights and the table"
```

---

### Task 15: The Issues panel, the issue layer, row marks, and the validation commands

**Files:**
- Create: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/issues.js`, `editcmds.js`, `fixeditor.js` (a stub here;
  Task 17 fills it)
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/index.html`, `app.css`
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/map.js`, `table.js`, `main.js`
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py`

`editcmds.js` imports `openFixEditor` from `fixeditor.js` (Task 17). To keep this task's module graph complete,
create `fixeditor.js` now with only that export as a stub:

```js
// The record and fix editor (Task 17).
export async function openFixEditor() {}
```

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py`:

```python
def test_issue_markers_and_validation_commands_use_the_slots():
    issues = (JS_DIR / "issues.js").read_text()
    assert 'addLayer(CORE, "roadway", "issues"' in issues and 'title: "Issues"' in issues
    assert '"issues"' not in (JS_DIR / "map.js").read_text()  # the layer lives in issues.js, not in map.js
    cmds = (JS_DIR / "editcmds.js").read_text()
    for command in ("run_validation", "fix_issue"):
        assert f'id: "{command}"' in cmds
    assert 'runCore("fix_issue")' in issues  # an issue's Fix button goes through the commands registry
    main = (JS_DIR / "main.js").read_text()
    assert "registerIssueLayer()" in main and "registerEditCommands()" in main
    html = (STATIC_DIR / "index.html").read_text()
    pane = html[html.index('id="dock-issues"') : html.index('id="dock-edits"')]
    for element_id in ("iss-edit", "iss-run", "iss-report", "iss-status", "iss-list", "iss-unlocated", "iss-fixer"):
        assert f'id="{element_id}"' in pane
    assert 'id="tg-issues"' not in html  # hidden through Layers → Overlays, not a toggle of its own
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to confirm it fails**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py -q -k validation_commands`
Expected: FAIL: `issues.js` does not exist.

- [ ] **Step 3: The pane**

In `index.html`, fill `<section class="dock-pane" id="dock-issues" …>`. Edit warnings come first: they are always
current, while a validation run can be stale. `#iss-fixer` holds the fix editor (one at a time).

```html
      <div id="iss-fixer"></div>
      <div class="label">Edit warnings <span id="iss-edit-count" class="pcount">0</span></div>
      <div id="iss-edit"><span class="empty">No edit warnings.</span></div>
      <div class="label">Validation</div>
      <div class="row wrap"><button class="mini" id="iss-run">Run validation</button>
        <a class="btn mini ghost off" id="iss-report" href="#" download>Export report</a></div>
      <div id="iss-status" class="diag">Not validated yet.</div>
      <div class="iss-filters">
        <select id="iss-sev" aria-label="Severity"></select>
        <select id="iss-table" aria-label="Table"></select>
        <select id="iss-code" aria-label="Issue code"></select>
        <label><input type="checkbox" id="iss-this"> This record</label>
      </div>
      <div id="iss-list"><span class="empty">Run validation to list issues.</span></div>
      <div class="iss-pager"><button class="mini ghost" id="iss-prev">&#8592;</button><span id="iss-range"></span>
        <button class="mini ghost" id="iss-next">&#8594;</button></div>
      <div class="label">Unlocated <span id="iss-unloc-count" class="pcount">0</span></div>
      <div id="iss-unlocated"></div>
```

Append to `app.css`:

```css
  .iss-filters { display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:6px; margin:8px 0; font-size:12px; }
  .iss-filters select { max-width:100%; }
  .iss { display:flex; gap:8px; align-items:flex-start; padding:7px 6px; border-bottom:1px solid var(--edge);
         cursor:pointer; font-size:12.5px; }
  .iss:hover, .iss.on { background:#20242e; }
  .iss .sev-dot { width:9px; height:9px; border-radius:50%; margin-top:4px; flex:none; }
  .sev-error .sev-dot { background:rgb(224,82,77); } .sev-warning .sev-dot { background:rgb(240,170,60); }
  .sev-info .sev-dot { background:rgb(90,150,220); }
  .iss-body { flex:1; min-width:0; } .iss-msg { color:var(--muted); overflow-wrap:anywhere; }
  .iss-pager { display:flex; align-items:center; gap:8px; margin:6px 0; font-size:12px; color:var(--muted); }
  #tbl-grid tr.iss td:first-child { box-shadow:inset 3px 0 0 rgb(240,170,60); }
```

- [ ] **Step 4: The commands**

Create `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/editcmds.js` (Task 17 adds the record and undo commands):

```js
// Core's validate and edit commands, registered like a plugin's (palette, feature and row menus). Core commands
// may read the page's store; plugin commands only get the frozen ctx.
import { dispatch } from "./api.js";
import { $, toast } from "./dom.js";
import { addCommandTo, commandContext, runCommand } from "./commands.js";
import { openFixEditor } from "./fixeditor.js";
import { CORE, slots } from "./slots.js";
import { store } from "./store.js";
import { showPanel } from "./workspaces.js";

const fail = e => toast(e.message);
const add = spec => addCommandTo(slots, store, CORE, { contexts: ["palette"], ...spec });

// Run one of core's registered commands with the current context (a button that does what a command does).
export function runCore(id) {
  const command = slots.commands.get(id), s = store.get();
  if (!command) return;
  const ctx = commandContext({ server: s.server, focus: s.focus, highlights: s.highlights, workspace: s.workspace });
  runCommand(command, ctx, (c, e) => fail(e));
}

export function registerEditCommands() {
  add({ id: "run_validation", group: "Issues", title: "Run validation", when: c => Boolean(c.network),
    run: () => { showPanel("issues"); return dispatch({ type: "run_validation" }); } });
  add({ id: "fix_issue", group: "Issues", title: "Fix the picked issue…", when: () => Boolean(store.get().fixTarget),
    run: () => { showPanel("issues"); return openFixEditor($("iss-fixer"), store.get().fixTarget); } });
}
```

- [ ] **Step 5: `issues.js`**

```js
// Issues panel: the live edit warnings, then validation: run it (a background job), list issues by filter, and link
// issue <-> map marker <-> row. The list, markers and report are read-only views of the last RunValidation and of
// GET /edits; nothing here is recorded. The markers are a core layer in the layer registry ("Issues" in Overlays).
import { getJSON, netPath } from "./api.js";
import { $, esc, toast } from "./dom.js";
import { runCore } from "./editcmds.js";
import { SEVERITIES, SEVERITY_RGB, issueMeta, issuesQuery, markerPoints, rangeLabel, statusLine } from "./issuelist.js";
import { addLayer, flyTo } from "./map.js";
import { CORE } from "./slots.js";

const PAGE = 100;

export function onIssuesState(s) {
  const meta = issueMeta(s.server), key = JSON.stringify([s.server && s.server.active, meta]);
  renderStatus(meta);
  if (key === metaKey) return;
  metaKey = key;
  loadMarkers().catch(fail);
  reloadIssues({ restart: true });
}

export function reloadIssues({ restart = false } = {}) {
  if (restart) offset = 0;
  loadList().catch(fail);
}

function renderStatus(meta) {
  const id = activeId(), current = meta && !meta.stale;
  $("iss-status").textContent = statusLine(meta);
  $("iss-run").textContent = meta && meta.stale ? "Re-run validation" : "Run validation";
  $("iss-report").classList.toggle("off", !current);
  $("iss-report").href = current && id ? netPath(id, "report.html") : "#";
}

// Pick what "Fix the picked issue…" edits, then run that command (the button and the palette do the same thing).
function fix(target) {
  store.set({ fixTarget: target });
  runCore("fix_issue");
}

function setFilter(patch) { store.set({ issueFilter: { ...store.get().issueFilter, ...patch } }); }

export function wireIssues() {
  $("iss-run").onclick = () => runCore("run_validation");
  $("iss-sev").onchange = e => setFilter({ severity: e.target.value ? [e.target.value] : [] });
  $("iss-table").onchange = e => setFilter({ table: e.target.value });
  $("iss-code").onchange = e => setFilter({ code: e.target.value });
  $("iss-this").onchange = e => setFilter({ thisRecord: e.target.checked });
  $("iss-prev").onclick = () => { offset = Math.max(0, offset - PAGE); reloadIssues(); };
  $("iss-next").onclick = () => { offset += PAGE; reloadIssues(); };
}
```

- [ ] **Step 6: `flyTo` in `map.js`**

Add after `flyToNode`:

```js
// Fly to a point that is not a feature (an issue that reported coordinates) and mark it.
export function flyTo(lon, lat) {
  if (!map) return;
  store.set({ marker: { lon, lat } });
  map.flyTo({ center: [lon, lat], zoom: Math.max(map.getZoom(), 15), duration: 500 });
}
```

No other `map.js` change: the issue layer registers through `addLayer`, and its `onClick` is its own.

- [ ] **Step 7: Row marks**

In `table.js`:
- import `recordIssues` from `./issuelist.js`;
- in `renderRows`, before the `body.innerHTML = …` line, add
  `const records = s.issues && s.issues.net_id === activeId() ? s.issues.records : null;`;
- in the row map, compute `const nIss = recordIssues(records, TBL.name, pv).length;`;
- pass `issues: nIss` to `rowMarks`;
- replace the `title` line with:

```js
    const tip = [vias[i] ? `related via ${vias[i]}` : "", nIss ? `${nIss} issue${nIss === 1 ? "" : "s"}` : ""].filter(Boolean).join(" · ");
    const title = tip ? ` title="${esc(tip)}"` : "";
```

- [ ] **Step 8: Wire it in `main.js`**

- import `{ markFocusedIssue, onIssuesState, registerIssueLayer, reloadIssues, renderEditWarnings, wireIssues }` from
  `./issues.js`, and `{ registerEditCommands }` from `./editcmds.js`;
- in `boot()`: call `registerEditCommands();` right after `registerCoreCommands();`; add `wireIssues();` to the
  `wire*()` line; call `registerIssueLayer();` right after that line (after `wireStore()`, so the `layerSeq`
  subscription that renders Overlays is already in place);
- add to `wireStore()`:

```js
  store.subscribe(["server"], s => onIssuesState(s));
  store.subscribe(["issueFilter"], s => { $("iss-this").checked = s.issueFilter.thisRecord; reloadIssues({ restart: true }); });
  store.subscribe(["focus"], s => { if (s.issueFilter.thisRecord) reloadIssues({ restart: true }); });
  store.subscribe(["issueFocus"], () => markFocusedIssue());
  store.subscribe(["issues", "issueFocus"], () => render());
  store.subscribe(["issues"], () => refreshRows());
  store.subscribe(["edits"], s => renderEditWarnings(s.edits));
```

- [ ] **Step 9: Run the static and JS tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_js.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_slots_js.py -q`
Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 10: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 11: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py
git commit -m "feat(workbench): Issues panel (edit warnings, validation), an issue layer in the registry, row marks"
```

### Task 16: Cell editing in the data table, with warning marks

A row click focuses the record (P1b). A click on a cell of the **focused** row opens that cell for editing: Enter
applies an `EditCells` action, Escape or leaving cancels. Cells with live edit warnings are underlined, with the
messages as their tooltip, and their row is marked. In the focused row a foreign-key cell shows its value as text
plus a small ↗ link, so a click on the value edits it and the ↗ still jumps to the referenced row. A right-click on a
row keeps opening Part 2's row menu (Task 17 adds Edit… and Delete… to it).

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/table.js`, `main.js`
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/index.html`, `app.css`

- [ ] **Step 1: Imports and state**

In `table.js`:
- change the api import to `import { dispatch, getJSON, netPath, postJSON } from "./api.js";`;
- add `import { cellAction, cellWarnings } from "./editmodel.js";`;
- after `let rowsTimer = …`, add:

```js
// The cell open for editing ({td, html}); rows do not reload under it, they catch up when it closes.
let editing = null;
```

- in `refreshRows`, change `if (!tableVisible()) { dirty = true; return; }` to
  `if (!tableVisible() || editing) { dirty = true; return; }`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Render marks and the focused row**

Replace `cellHTML` with:

```js
// A grid cell. A navigable foreign key is a link to its row; in the focused row the value is plain text (a click
// edits it) and a small ↗ does the jump.
function cellHTML(value, fk, focused = false) {
  if (value === null) return '<span class="empty">·</span>';
  if (fk && fk.navigable) {
    const link = `<a class="fk${focused ? " go" : ""}" href="#" data-ref="${esc(fk.ref_table)}" data-id="${esc(value)}" ` +
      `data-num="${typeof value === "number" ? 1 : ""}" title="Go to ${esc(fk.ref_table)} ${esc(value)}">${focused ? "↗" : esc(value)}</a>`;
    return focused ? `${esc(value)} ${link}` : link;
  }
  return esc(value);
}
```

In `renderRows`:
- keep the page for the cell editor: add `TBL.cols = cols; TBL.rows = rows;` at the top;
- before `body.innerHTML = …`, add
  `const warned = s.edits && s.edits.net_id === activeId() ? cellWarnings(s.edits.warnings, TBL.name) : {};`;
- in the row map, after `pv`, add `const rw = warned[String(pv)];` and
  `const focused = Boolean(s.focus && s.focus.table === TBL.name && s.focus.id === pv);`, pass `warned: Boolean(rw)`
  to `rowMarks` (next to Task 15's `issues: nIss`), and replace the `tds` line with:

```js
    const tds = r.map((v, c) => {
      const msgs = rw && rw[cols[c]];
      const mark = msgs ? ` class="cw" title="${esc(msgs.join("\n"))}"` : "";
      return `<td data-c="${c}"${mark}>${cellHTML(v, fks.get(cols[c]), focused)}</td>`;
    }).join("");
```

- replace the row click wiring (`for (const tr of body.querySelectorAll("tr.data")) tr.onclick = () => rowClick(tr.dataset.pk);`)
  with the lines below; leave the `oncontextmenu` wiring as it is:

```js
  for (const tr of body.querySelectorAll("tr.data")) tr.onclick = e => {
    const td = e.target.closest("td[data-c]");
    if (tr.classList.contains("focus") && td && editableColumn(TBL.cols[Number(td.dataset.c)])) startCellEdit(tr, td);
    else rowClick(tr.dataset.pk);
  };
```

- [ ] **Step 3: The cell editor**

Add after `rowClick`:

```js
// The key is never edited in a cell (decision 2); everything else may be (the server refuses what it cannot hold).
const editableColumn = name => Boolean(name) && name !== TBL.schema.primary_key;

// Edit one cell of the focused row in place: Enter applies an EditCells action; Escape or leaving cancels.
function startCellEdit(tr, td) {
  if (editing) return;
  const c = Number(td.dataset.c), column = TBL.cols[c];
  const current = TBL.rows[[...tr.parentNode.children].indexOf(tr)][c];
  const id = coerceId(tr.dataset.pk, pkNumeric());
  editing = { td, html: td.innerHTML };
  td.innerHTML = `<input class="cell-in" aria-label="${esc(column)}">`;
  const input = td.querySelector("input");
  input.value = current == null ? "" : String(current);
  const close = () => {
    if (!editing || editing.td !== td) return;
    td.innerHTML = editing.html;
    editing = null;
    if (dirty) refreshRows();
  };
  input.onclick = e => e.stopPropagation();
  input.oncontextmenu = e => e.stopPropagation(); // the browser's own menu (paste) inside the input, not the row menu
  input.onblur = () => setTimeout(close, 150); // an Enter in flight wins
  input.onkeydown = async e => {
    if (e.key === "Escape") { close(); return; }
    if (e.key !== "Enter") return;
    try {
      await dispatch(cellAction({ table: TBL.name, ids: [id], column, raw: input.value, current }));
      editing = null; // the edit bumps the version: the rows reload with the new value and its warnings
      refreshRows();
    } catch (err) { toast(err.message); input.focus(); }
  };
  input.focus();
  input.select();
}
```

`cellAction` throws for a bad boolean before anything is sent; the server refuses a value its column cannot hold.
Either way the toast says why and the input stays open.

- [ ] **Step 4: Styles, the hint and the wiring**

Append to `app.css`:

```css
  #tbl-grid td.cw { box-shadow:inset 0 -2px 0 rgb(240,170,60); }
  #tbl-grid tr.warn td:first-child { box-shadow:inset 3px 0 0 rgb(224,120,60); }
  #tbl-grid tr.focus td { cursor:text; }
  #tbl-grid a.fk.go { text-decoration:none; opacity:.75; margin-left:2px; }
  .cell-in { width:100%; min-width:64px; font:inherit; padding:1px 4px; }
```

In `index.html`, in `#tbl-bar` after `<span id="tbl-hint" class="empty"></span>`, add
`<span class="diag">Click a row, then a cell of it, to edit.</span>`.

In `main.js`, add to `wireStore()`: `store.subscribe(["edits"], () => refreshRows());` (the warning marks follow the
live check).

- [ ] **Step 5: Run the static and JS tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_js.py -q`
Expected: all pass (`test_context_menus_are_wired_on_the_map_the_grid_and_the_selection` still finds
`openContextMenu("row"` and `oncontextmenu` in `table.js`). The editing behaviour itself is checked in the Task 18
walk-through.

- [ ] **Step 6: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 7: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static
git commit -m "feat(workbench): edit cells in the data table; live warning marks on cells and rows"
```

### Task 17: The record and fix editor, Edit… and Delete… commands, the Edits panel, Undo, Save a copy, and the switcher badge

**Files:**
- Modify (fill the stub): `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/fixeditor.js`
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/js/editcmds.js`, `edits.js`, `side.js`, `header.js`, `main.js`
- Modify: `packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static/index.html`, `app.css`
- Test: `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py`

- [ ] **Step 1: Write the failing test**

Append to `packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py`:

```python
def test_record_edits_undo_and_save_are_registered_commands():
    cmds = (JS_DIR / "editcmds.js").read_text()
    assert 'id: "edit_record"' in cmds and 'id: "delete_record"' in cmds
    assert cmds.count('contexts: ["feature", "row"]') == 2
    for command in ("undo_edit", "save_copy"):
        assert f'id: "{command}"' in cmds
    fix = (JS_DIR / "fixeditor.js").read_text()
    assert 'from "./formview.js"' in fix and "schemaForm(" in fix and "recordSchema(" in fix
    html = (STATIC_DIR / "index.html").read_text()
    pane = html[html.index('id="dock-edits"') : html.index("</aside>")]
    for element_id in ("ed-undo", "ed-undo-why", "ed-status", "ed-list", "ed-save-name", "ed-save-format", "ed-save", "ed-save-fb"):
        assert f'id="{element_id}"' in pane
    header = (JS_DIR / "header.js").read_text()
    assert "dirtyBadge(" in header and "networkBadge(" in header
```

- [ ] **Step 2: Run it to confirm it fails**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py -q -k registered_commands`
Expected: FAIL: no `edit_record` command.

- [ ] **Step 3: `fixeditor.js`**

Replace the stub:

```js
// The record editor (Details → Edit…, or Edit… on a feature or row) and the fix editor (an issue's Fix…): a
// generated form (wb.schemaForm, formview.js) over the record's editable columns, or just the issue's column,
// that sends one EditCells action with only what changed. Ported from the offline report's "Fix locally"
// mini-editor (map_component.js). Delete asks the server what the cascade would remove (a dry run) first.
import { dispatch, getJSON, netPath, postJSON } from "./api.js";
import { esc, toast } from "./dom.js";
import { changedValues, deleteAction, deletePlanText, recordSchema } from "./editmodel.js";
import { schemaForm } from "./formview.js";
import { activeSelection, store } from "./store.js";

// Open the editor in `host` for {table, id, column?, note?}; it replaces whatever editor `host` held.
export async function openFixEditor(host, { table, id, column = null, note = "" }) {
  const s = store.get(), net = s.server.active;
  const [rec, schema] = await Promise.all([
    getJSON(netPath(net, `feature/${encodeURIComponent(table)}/${encodeURIComponent(id)}`)),
    getJSON(netPath(net, `table/${encodeURIComponent(table)}/schema`)),
  ]);
  const formSchema = recordSchema(schema.columns, schema.primary_key, column ? [column] : null);
  const keys = Object.keys(formSchema.properties);
  const before = Object.fromEntries(keys.map(k => [k, rec.attributes[k] ?? null]));
  const sel = activeSelection(s);
  const many = table === "link" && sel && sel.link_ids.includes(id) && sel.link_ids.length > 1;
  host.innerHTML = `<div class="fix-editor" role="group" aria-label="Edit ${esc(table)} ${esc(id)}">` +
    `<div class="row"><b>${esc(table)} ${esc(id)}</b>${column ? ` <span class="diag">${esc(column)}</span>` : ""}</div>` +
    `<div class="fx-form"></div>` +
    `<div class="row"><input class="fx-note grow" aria-label="Note" placeholder="Why (kept with the edit)" value="${esc(note || "")}"></div>` +
    (many ? `<label class="row"><input type="checkbox" class="fx-sel"> all ${sel.link_ids.length} selected links</label>` : "") +
    `<div class="row"><button class="mini fx-apply">Apply</button><button class="mini ghost fx-cancel">Cancel</button>` +
    `<button class="mini ghost fx-delete">Delete…</button></div></div>`;
  const el = host.querySelector(".fix-editor");
  const form = schemaForm(el.querySelector(".fx-form"), formSchema, before);
  el.querySelector(".fx-cancel").onclick = () => el.remove();
  el.querySelector(".fx-delete").onclick = () => deleteRecord(table, id).then(done => { if (done) el.remove(); });
  el.querySelector(".fx-apply").onclick = async () => {
    const errors = form.errors();
    if (errors.length) { toast(errors.join("; ")); return; }
    const values = changedValues(before, form.value(), keys);
    if (!Object.keys(values).length) { toast("Nothing changed."); return; }
    const box = el.querySelector(".fx-sel"), why = el.querySelector(".fx-note").value.trim();
    const action = { type: "edit_cells", table, ids: box && box.checked ? [...sel.link_ids] : [id], values };
    if (why) action.note = why;
    try { await dispatch(action); el.remove(); } catch (e) { toast(e.message); }
  };
  form.focus();
}

// Delete one record after showing what goes with it; resolves to whether it was deleted.
export async function deleteRecord(table, id) {
  try {
    const plan = await postJSON(netPath(store.get().server.active, `table/${encodeURIComponent(table)}/delete-plan`), { ids: [id] });
    if (plan.refused) { toast(plan.refused); return false; }
    if (!window.confirm(deletePlanText(plan))) return false;
    await dispatch(deleteAction(table, [id]));
    return true;
  } catch (e) { toast(e.message); return false; }
}
```

`schemaForm` parses each control by its kind (a number box for `num`, a three-way menu for a nullable `bool`, text
for `str`); a blank field clears the cell. The server still coerces to the column's real type and refuses what does
not fit (an integer column and `1.5`).

- [ ] **Step 4: Edit and delete from Details**

In `side.js`:
- import `{ deleteRecord, openFixEditor }` from `./fixeditor.js`;
- turn `showDetails` into a wrapper that remembers its render, so a command can wait for it:

```js
let detailsShown = Promise.resolve();
// The last showDetails render (a command that opens the editor in Details waits for it).
export const detailsSettled = () => detailsShown;

export function showDetails(table, id) {
  detailsShown = renderDetails(table, id);
  return detailsShown;
}
```

  and rename the existing `export async function showDetails(table, id)` to `async function renderDetails(table, id)`;
- in `renderDetails`, replace `el.innerHTML = \`${head}<table>${rows}</table>\`;` with:

```js
    const actions = `<div class="row det-actions"><button class="mini ghost" data-act="edit">Edit…</button>` +
      `<button class="mini ghost" data-act="delete">Delete…</button></div><div class="det-edit"></div>`;
    el.innerHTML = `${head}${actions}<table>${rows}</table>`;
    el.querySelector('[data-act="edit"]').onclick = () =>
      openFixEditor(el.querySelector(".det-edit"), { table, id }).catch(e => toast(e.message));
    el.querySelector('[data-act="delete"]').onclick = () => deleteRecord(table, id);
```

Any focused record can be edited (any table with a key); the delete plan says when a deletion is refused (a node a
link uses) before anything happens.

- [ ] **Step 5: The commands**

In `editcmds.js`:
- extend the imports: `import { editSummary, undoBlocked } from "./editmodel.js";`,
  `import { deleteRecord, openFixEditor } from "./fixeditor.js";` (replacing the single import), and
  `import { detailsSettled } from "./side.js";`;
- add before `registerEditCommands`:

```js
// Focus the record (Details shows it), then open the record editor in Details.
async function editRecord(table, id) {
  showPanel("details");
  const f = store.get().focus;
  if (!f || f.table !== table || f.id !== id) store.set({ focus: { table, id, from: "table" } });
  await detailsSettled();
  const host = document.querySelector("#details .det-edit");
  if (host) await openFixEditor(host, { table, id });
}
```

- add at the end of `registerEditCommands`:

```js
  // A right-clicked map feature or grid row (and, in the palette, the focused record's "For …" group).
  add({ id: "edit_record", title: "Edit…", contexts: ["feature", "row"], when: c => Boolean(c.target),
    run: c => editRecord(c.target.table, c.target.id) });
  add({ id: "delete_record", title: "Delete…", contexts: ["feature", "row"], when: c => Boolean(c.target),
    run: c => deleteRecord(c.target.table, c.target.id) });
  add({ id: "undo_edit", group: "Edits", title: "Undo last edit", when: c => !undoBlocked(editSummary(c.state)),
    run: () => dispatch({ type: "undo_edit" }) });
  add({ id: "save_copy", group: "Edits", title: "Save a copy…", when: c => Boolean(c.network),
    run: () => { showPanel("edits"); $("ed-save-name").focus(); } });
```

With `edit_record` and `delete_record` registered, a right-click on a link, a node or a keyed grid row always opens a
menu (R8); Part 2's right-drag guard still keeps MapLibre's rotate.

- [ ] **Step 6: The Edits pane**

In `index.html`, fill `<section class="dock-pane" id="dock-edits" …>`:

```html
      <p class="diag">Every change to this network since it was opened, newest first: your edits, Python's and any
        plugin's. Undo reverses your newest edit. The strip at the bottom is the session history (every action).</p>
      <div class="row wrap"><button class="mini ghost" id="ed-undo" disabled>Undo last</button>
        <span class="diag" id="ed-undo-why"></span></div>
      <div id="ed-status" class="diag"></div>
      <div id="ed-list"><span class="empty">No edits yet.</span></div>
      <div class="label">Save a copy</div>
      <div class="row wrap"><input id="ed-save-name" placeholder="leavenworth-fixed" aria-label="Copy name">
        <select id="ed-save-format" aria-label="Format"><option value="parquet">Parquet folder</option>
          <option value="csv">CSV folder</option><option value="duckdb">DuckDB file</option><option value="zip">Zip</option></select>
        <button class="mini ghost" id="ed-save">Choose folder…</button></div>
      <div class="fb" id="ed-save-fb" hidden></div>
```

Append to `app.css`:

```css
  .chg { padding:7px 0; border-bottom:1px solid var(--edge); font-size:12.5px; }
  .chg.unsaved { box-shadow:inset 3px 0 0 var(--accent); padding-left:8px; }
  .fix-editor { margin:6px 0; padding:8px; border:1px solid var(--edge); border-radius:8px; background:#0c0e12; }
  .fix-editor .row { display:flex; gap:6px; align-items:center; margin:4px 0; }
  .row.wrap { flex-wrap:wrap; }
```

- [ ] **Step 7: The Edits panel in `edits.js`**

Extend Task 14's `edits.js`: change its imports to

```js
import { dispatch, getJSON, netPath } from "./api.js";
import { $, esc, toast } from "./dom.js";
import { dirtyBadge, editsBadge, pendingLine, undoBlocked } from "./editmodel.js";
import { createFileBrowser } from "./filebrowser.js";
import { issuesBadge } from "./issuelist.js";
import { ALL_WORKSPACES, CORE } from "./slots.js";
import { store } from "./store.js";
import { addPanel } from "./workspaces.js";
```

and add:

```js
let saver = null;
const fail = e => toast(e.message);

// The Edits panel: pending edits (newest first), why Undo is unavailable, dirty state and the save controls. The
// panel's tab badge comes from editsBadge (registered in registerEditPanels).
export function renderEdits(edits) {
  const e = edits && edits.net_id === activeId() ? edits : null;
  const why = undoBlocked(e);
  $("ed-undo").disabled = Boolean(why);
  $("ed-undo-why").textContent = e && e.pending ? why : "";
  const parts = e ? [dirtyBadge(e) || (e.pending ? "Every edit is in a saved copy." : ""),
    e.warnings.length ? `${e.warnings.length} open warning(s): see Issues.` : "",
    e.truncated ? "The live check was cut short: run validation." : ""] : [];
  $("ed-status").textContent = parts.filter(Boolean).join(" · ");
  $("ed-list").innerHTML = e && e.entries.length ? e.entries.map(x =>
    `<div class="chg${x.saved ? "" : " unsaved"}">${esc(pendingLine(x))}<div class="diag">` +
    `${esc(Object.entries(x.rows).map(([t, n]) => `${n} ${t}`).join(", "))} · v${x.version}${x.saved ? " · saved" : ""}</div></div>`).join("")
    : '<span class="empty">No edits yet. Click a row, then a cell, to edit it; or fix an issue.</span>';
}

// Save a copy into `folder`. Open warnings are listed first, and saving anyway is an explicit choice.
function save(folder) {
  const e = store.get().edits, n = e ? e.warnings.length : 0;
  const action = { type: "save_network", output_dir: folder, name: $("ed-save-name").value.trim(),
    output_format: $("ed-save-format").value };
  if (n) {
    const shown = e.warnings.slice(0, 10).map(w => `• ${w.message}`).join("\n");
    const more = n > 10 ? `\n… and ${n - 10} more` : "";
    if (!window.confirm(`${n} edit warning${n === 1 ? " is" : "s are"} still open:\n${shown}${more}\n\nSave the copy anyway?`)) return;
    action.accept_warnings = true;
  }
  dispatch(action).then(() => toast("Saving a copy… (see Jobs)")).catch(fail);
}

export function wireEdits() {
  $("ed-undo").onclick = () => dispatch({ type: "undo_edit" }).catch(fail);
  $("ed-save").onclick = () => {
    if (!$("ed-save-name").value.trim()) { toast("Name the copy first."); $("ed-save-name").focus(); return; }
    const fb = $("ed-save-fb");
    fb.hidden = !fb.hidden;
    if (fb.hidden) return;
    saver ||= createFileBrowser(fb, { kinds: [], pickFolder: true, onPick: entry => { fb.hidden = true; save(entry.path); } });
    saver.show();
  };
}
```

`save_network` is a job: the request answers 202 at once, and the outcome arrives as a `job` event in the Jobs
panel (a refusal lists the warnings in its history entry).

- [ ] **Step 8: The dirty badge in the network switcher**

In `header.js`, import `{ dirtyBadge }` from `./editmodel.js`, and in `renderHeader` compose it with Part 2's derived
mark (plugins design, UX principle 7). A clean base network's option stays exactly as before:

```js
    ? server.networks.map(n => {
      const mark = networkBadge(n); // a base network's option is exactly as before
      const marks = [dirtyBadge((server.edits || {})[n.id]), mark].filter(Boolean).join(" • ");
      return `<option value="${esc(n.id)}"${n.id === server.active ? " selected" : ""}` +
        `${mark ? ` title="${esc(derivedTitle(n, server.networks))}"` : ""}>${esc(n.label)}${marks ? ` • ${esc(marks)}` : ""}</option>`;
    }).join("")
```

`editmodel.js` is import-free, so `header.js` importing it adds no cycle.

- [ ] **Step 9: Wire it**

In `main.js`:
- import `{ renderEdits, wireEdits }` from `./edits.js` (next to Task 14's `onEditsState, registerEditPanels`);
- add `wireEdits();` to the `wire*()` line in `boot()`;
- add to `wireStore()`: `store.subscribe(["edits"], s => renderEdits(s.edits));`

- [ ] **Step 10: Run the static and JS tests**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_js.py packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_slots_js.py -q`
Expected: all pass. Every new id is in `index.html`, and every import resolves (`fixeditor.js` → `formview.js`,
`editcmds.js` → `side.js`; `side.js` → `fixeditor.js` only, so no cycle).

- [ ] **Step 11: Before commit**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q` and the ruff pair. Expected: all pass.

- [ ] **Step 12: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/netstead/workbench/static packages/netstead/tests/test_workbench_static.py
git commit -m "feat(workbench): record and fix editor (schema form), Edit/Delete/Undo/Save commands, Edits panel, dirty badge"
```

### Task 18: Docs, the full suite, lint, and the browser walk-through

**Files:**
- Modify: `packages/netstead/docs/cookbook/workbench.md`
- Modify: `docs/design/2026-10-02-netstead-workbench-design.md`, `docs/design/README.md`

- [ ] **Step 1: The Workbench cookbook**

In `packages/netstead/docs/cookbook/workbench.md`, add before `## Language models …`:

```markdown
## Validate and fix

- **Issues → Run validation** (or **Run validation** in the command palette, Ctrl+K / ⌘K) checks the spec, the
  keys and the quality rules, as a background job. The rules use **Settings → Validation** (`validation.rules`,
  keyed by rule code, such as `quality.high_speed_residential`).
- Click an issue: its record is focused, the map flies to it and its row is marked. Click a dot on the map:
  the Issues panel opens on that record's issues. Rows with issues are marked in the table. **Layers → Overlays →
  Issues** hides the dots.
- Filter by severity, table and code. **This record** lists only the focused record's issues. Issues with
  no place on the map are listed under **Unlocated**.
- After an edit the validation says it is stale: **Re-run validation** checks again. **Export report**
  downloads the offline HTML report for a current validation.

## Edit tables

- **In the table:** click a row to focus it, then click one of its cells, type, and press Enter (Escape
  cancels; an empty value clears the cell). The key column is not edited in place.
- **A whole record:** **Edit…** in Details, or right-click a link, a node or a row → **Edit…**, opens a form
  for every editable column (or for every selected link at once). **Fix** on an issue opens it on that column.
- **Delete…** (Details, the editor, or the right-click menu) first says what goes with the record: a link takes
  its lanes and time-of-day rows. A node that a link still uses cannot be deleted.
- **Adding rows** is Python or the API only: `app.do(AddRows(table="node", rows=[{...}]))`.
- Each edit is one action in the session history (so "copy as Python" replays it), bumps the network's
  version, and is listed in the **Edits** panel. **Undo last** (or **Undo last edit** in the palette) reverses
  your newest edit; changes a plugin made are undone in that plugin, and changes made from Python with
  `session.undo_last(net_id, source="python")`.
- A selection follows an edit: one made by a query is resolved again, one made by clicking keeps its links,
  minus any you deleted.

### Edit warnings

An edit the spec disagrees with is still applied, and warned about at once: a foreign key that is not in the
referenced table, a required field left empty, a value of the wrong type or outside the allowed list, or a
duplicate key. The cell is underlined (hover for why), the row is marked, and the warning is listed at the
top of the Issues panel with a **Fix** button. A later edit that puts it right clears the warning.

### Save a copy

**Edits → Save a copy** (or **Save a copy…** in the palette) writes the edited network to a new folder or file
inside your allowed folders; the network you opened, local or remote, is never written to. If edit warnings are
still open, they are listed and you choose whether to save anyway (`SaveNetwork(..., accept_warnings=True)` in
Python). The badge on the Edits tab and in the network switcher counts edits no saved copy holds yet; with a
plugin's workspace open, the Inspect tab shows a dirty mark too.
```

- [ ] **Step 2: The design records**

In `docs/design/2026-10-02-netstead-workbench-design.md`, below the P1b plan line under the phasing table, add:

```markdown
P2 plan: [2026-10-07-workbench-p2-plan.md](2026-10-07-workbench-p2-plan.md): validation and direct table edits in core
(live warnings, cascading deletes, undo, Save a copy), built on plugins Parts 1 and 2. ProjectCard editing is the cards
plugin's ([scope](2026-10-07-cards-plugin-scope.md)).
```

In `docs/design/README.md`, set this plan's status to `implemented` with the PR number, move it from "In flight" to
the plans table, and update the Workbench design row's notes ("P2 implemented; next: …").

- [ ] **Step 3: The full tier, before merge**

Run: `uv run --all-extras pytest packages -n auto -q -m ""`
Expected: all pass, including `slow` (the doc contract test runs the cookbook pages), `perf`, and the
`plugin_discovery` tests if the hello example is installed.

Run: `uv run ruff check packages && uv run ruff format --check packages && uv run lint-imports && uv run python scripts/lint_no_sql.py`
Expected: clean. `lint-imports` keeps every contract: `netstead.workbench` imports no plugin package.

- [ ] **Step 4: Browser walk-through**

Start the app through `preview_start`, with a `.claude/launch.json` entry that runs
`uv run netstead app packages/netstead/netstead/fixtures/leavenworth/parquet --port 8852`. Then check each item:

1. **Panels.** The dock shows **Details | Issues | Edits**; with no plugin the workspace strip stays hidden.
2. **Validate.**
   - Issues → **Run validation**. The Jobs badge counts it, and the panel then reads
     `Validated v0: 272 warnings, 16 info`; the Issues tab badge reads 288.
   - Orange dots appear on the map, and the Unlocated list has 17 entries. Layers → Overlays lists **Issues**;
     switching it off hides the dots.
3. **Issue ↔ map ↔ row.**
   - Split view, link table. Click a `quality.high_speed_residential` issue. The map flies to the link, its row
     is focused and scrolled into view, and the row carries the issue mark.
   - Click another dot on the map. The Issues panel opens on **This record**, with that issue marked.
4. **Fix from an issue.**
   - Click **Fix** on link 1's issue. The editor shows `free_speed`, now 40. Enter `30` and Apply.
   - The row shows 30, and the focus and table page are unchanged (no reset).
   - The Edits panel lists `#1 link 1: free_speed = 30.0 (…)`, its tab badge reads 1 with a dirty dot, the
     network switcher shows `• 1 unsaved`, and the bottom strip shows `app.do(EditCells(...))`.
   - The Issues panel says the validation is stale. **Re-run validation** gives 271 warnings, and **Export
     report** downloads `leavenworth-validation.html`.
5. **Cell edit with a warning.** Focus link 2's row, click its `from_node_id` value, type `424242`, Enter. The cell
   is underlined (hover: "is not a node.node_id"), the row is marked, and Issues → Edit warnings lists it. Click
   the cell again, type link 2's old value, Enter: the warning clears.
6. **Refusal.** Click link 1's `lanes` cell, type `1.5`, Enter. A toast says it does not fit; nothing changes
   and no edit is listed.
7. **Context menus and the palette.** Right-click a link: the menu offers **Edit…** and **Delete…**; Edit… opens
   the record form in Details. Ctrl+K (⌘K): **Undo last edit**, **Run validation** and **Save a copy…** are listed;
   with a record focused, its "For link …" group lists Edit… and Delete….
8. **Undo.** Edits → **Undo last** (or the palette). The value is back, the entry is gone, and the history has
   `UndoEdit`.
9. **Delete and the selection.** Select "Ski Hill Drive" (20 links). Details for one of its links → **Delete…**.
   The confirmation names the lane rows that go with it. Confirm: the link disappears from the map, the lane count
   in the rail drops, and the selection now has 19 links. **Undo last** brings all three back. Details for node 1 →
   **Delete…**: refused, naming the links that use it.
10. **Save with a warning.** Make an edit with a warning (step 5's first half), then **Save a copy**: the
    confirmation lists the warning. Cancel: nothing is written. Save again and accept: the job writes the copy,
    the badges clear, and the opened fixture is unchanged (re-open it to check).
11. **A plugin's change** (optional, with `examples/workbench-plugin-hello` installed): its Actions still run; if a
    plugin mutates, the Edits panel lists the change with the plugin's name and **Undo last** says to undo it there.
12. **Network.** Nothing goes to a non-local host except the basemap tiles and the CDN.

Fix anything that fails before opening the PR. Reset the viewport afterwards (`preset: "desktop"`) if you changed
it.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

```bash
git add packages/netstead/docs/cookbook/workbench.md docs/design/2026-10-02-netstead-workbench-design.md docs/design/README.md
git commit -m "docs(workbench): validate, edit tables, edit warnings and save a copy"
```

## Self-review (against the design)

**Spec coverage:**

| Requirement | Where |
|---|---|
| Validation + quality checks as a job, rule config from Settings | Task 9 (`RunValidation`, `run_validation`, `rule_configs`; `severity_override` checked at load) |
| Issues panel: issue ↔ map marker ↔ table row | Task 9 (keys and anchors), 10 (`/issues`, `/issues/markers`), 15 (list, the issue layer, row marks, `onIssueMarker`) |
| Filter by severity, table, code; unlocated listed separately | Task 10 (`query`, facets, `located=no`), 15 (selects, "This record", Unlocated) |
| Export report via `render_validation_html` | Task 10 (`/report.html`, refused when stale), 15 (button) |
| Edits in the UX: cell edits; the ported "fix locally" editor from an issue; a record editor | Task 16 (cells), 17 (`fixeditor.js` on `schemaForm`, Details, Edit… command), 13 (`parseCell` from `coerceLikely`, `recordSchema`) |
| Edits apply through `Host.mutate`/`Session.mutate` as corral `update_rows`/`delete_rows`/`add_rows`, in history, version bump + lineage | Task 3 (plans), 5 (`mutate` + ledger), 8 (Actions on the registry) |
| Live, non-blocking warnings: FK missing, required empty, type/enum, duplicate key; on cell, row and Issues panel | Task 4 (`check_rows`), 5 (re-check after every mutation and revert), 15 (Issues list), 16 (cell and row marks) |
| Warnings shown before saving; explicit confirmation while any remain | Task 11 (`accept_warnings`), 17 (confirmation listing them) |
| Pending-edits list with a dirty badge (UX principle 7) | Task 5 (`EditLedger.summary`), 12 (`/edits`), 14 (panel badge via `addPanel`), 17 (Edits panel, switcher badge) |
| Undo of the last edit, one at a time, itself a recorded Action (decision a) | Task 5 (`revert`, `undo_last`), 8 (`UndoEdit`), 17 (button and palette command) |
| Delete cascades through spec FKs and shows what goes; a referenced node is refused (decision b) | Task 3 (`plan_delete`), 12 (`delete-plan`), 17 (`deleteRecord`, Delete… command) |
| Adding rows from Python and the API (decision b) | Task 3 (`plan_add`), 8 (`AddRows`) |
| Live checks per edit; full validation stale with a manual Re-run (decision c) | Tasks 4–5 (live), 9 (`stale`), 15 ("Re-run validation", `run_validation` command) |
| Built on Plugins Parts 1 and 2; Actions on the registry (decision d) | Header; Tasks 5–8 (Part 1 as built), 14–17 (Part 2 slots) |
| A failed Action leaves no pending edit, no selection change | Task 5 (`_LedgerMark`), 6 (`_roll_back` restores the selection) |
| The stored selection after an edit (R4) | Task 6 |
| Issues and Edits through the dock, with badges (Part 2) | Task 14 (`addPanel`, `issuesBadge`, `editsBadge`) |
| Issue markers through the layer registry (Part 2) | Task 15 (`addLayer(CORE, "roadway", "issues", …)`) |
| Context commands and the palette (Part 2) | Tasks 15 (`run_validation`, `fix_issue`), 17 (`edit_record`, `delete_record`, `undo_edit`, `save_copy`) |
| `schemaForm` for edit forms (Part 2) | Task 17 (`fixeditor.js`) |
| "Copy as Python" byte-identical for old sessions; new Actions bring their imports | Task 8 (`_SCRIPT_HEADER`, `script_imports`; the server tests stay green) |
| Host API 1.2 | Task 7 |
| `to_projectcard` always writes `ignore_missing`; `host.selection` exposes the facility form | Task 2 |
| Save writes a new copy inside the allowed roots, never overwrites; `OutOfSyncWarning` handled | Task 11 |
| Nothing mutates silently (UX principle 3) | Task 5: every mutation and revert, core, Python or plugin, is a pending edit with its source; outside an Action Part 1 also records it |
| corral null-safe undo | Task 1 |
| An edit keeps the current view | Task 14 (`netChange`, `onNetworkEdited`) |

**Placeholder scan:**
- No "TBD" and no "similar to Task N".
- New files are given in full, except `fixeditor.js` (a stub in Task 15, given in full in Task 17), `edits.js` (the
  panels and feed in Task 14, the Edits panel added in Task 17) and `editcmds.js` (two commands in Task 15, four
  more in Task 17).
- Conditional instructions remain only where the plan cannot know a fact. Each says what to check and what to do:
  - `DataPackage`'s required fields (Task 3);
  - a private-import lint on `_schemas` (Task 4);
  - existing selection tests that compare a whole payload (Task 6).

**Name consistency:**
- Python: `plan_update/plan_delete/plan_add`, `EditPlan(edits, summary, rows, keys, recheck)`, `EditRefused`,
  `check_rows`, `CheckResult.for_rows/to_dict`, `touched_keys`,
  `EditLedger.copy/add/last/pop/touched/mark_saved/summary`, `PendingEdit.view`, `CORE_SOURCE`, `PYTHON_SOURCE`,
  `Session.mutate(..., origin, recheck)/revert/undo_last(..., source)/edit_check/edits_payload/delete_preview/issue_set`,
  `Session._swap/_ledger_for/_source/_settle/_recheck/_refresh_selection`, `_LedgerMark`, and
  `Host.undo/edit_warnings/plan_*` are used the same way in Tasks 3–17.
- Action `type`s: `run_validation`, `edit_cells`, `delete_rows`, `add_rows`, `undo_edit`, `save_network`. These are
  what the front end dispatches (`editcmds.js`, `table.js`, `fixeditor.js`/`editmodel.js`, `edits.js`).
- Store keys (`issues`, `issueFilter`, `issueFocus`, `fixTarget`, `edits`) are the same across `store.js`,
  `main.js`, `issues.js`, `editcmds.js`, `table.js` and `edits.js`.
- Dock panel ids `issues`, `edits` (panes `#dock-issues`, `#dock-edits`); layer id `issues`; command ids
  `run_validation`, `fix_issue`, `edit_record`, `delete_record`, `undo_edit`, `save_copy` (core's are bare, Part 2
  Decision 1).
- Ids added to `index.html`: `dock-issues`, `dock-edits`, `iss-*`, `ed-*`. None were removed. The static tests
  enforce both directions.

**Risks:**
- **Edits on large networks.** Each edit to a big table round-trips that table through Arrow (on the draft), and
  every edit to `link` or `node` re-packs `network.bin`. Regional networks with 1M+ links will feel it; the
  follow-up is a DuckDB-native `update_rows`.
- **Live checks grow with the ledger.** They re-check every key any pending edit touched; `MAX_CHECKED_KEYS` bounds
  each table, and the Edits panel says when the check was cut short.
- **The ledger snapshot per Action.** `_ledger_for` copies the ledger (entries one level down; results shared) each
  time an Action changes it. Pending edits are few (one per user edit), so this is cheap; a script that dispatches
  thousands of edits in one session would want a lighter mark (the entry count and `_seq`).
- **Issue positions.** They assume DuckDB returns a table in the same order to `to_pandas()` and to
  `select(pk).to_pandas()`. Task 9 pins this on Leavenworth, whose tables happen to be sorted by key. A multi-file
  parquet source could break it; the longer-term fix is for rules to report keys in `Issue.extra`.
- **`warnings.catch_warnings` in `SaveNetwork`** is process-global. A warning raised on another thread during a
  save could be swallowed into the save's notes. Jobs are few and short; noted in the code.
- **Concurrent validation and edits.** An edit while a validation job runs can give the job a mix of versions. The
  result is stored with the version it started on, so it shows as stale and the UI offers a re-run.
- **Undo after another source's change.** Strict LIFO across sources means core's Undo is blocked until the plugin
  (or Python) undoes its own change. That is deliberate (a plugin's draft state stays true), and the Edits panel
  says who to ask.
- **A nested core edit inside a plugin Action** (`host.dispatch(EditCells(...))`) is a `"workbench"` pending edit,
  so the plugin's `host.undo` refuses it and core's Undo reverses it. A plugin that wants to own an edit uses
  `host.plan_*` + `host.mutate` instead; the authoring guide says so.
- **Right-click now always opens a menu on features and keyed rows** (R8). Part 2's gesture guard keeps
  right-drag rotate on the map; on a row the browser's own menu is one Escape away.
- **Snippets not run.** Tasks 5–17 were written against the Part 1/Part 2 code as built (see the honesty note) but
  not executed. Where a name or signature turns out different, adapt the snippet to the code, not the other way
  round.
