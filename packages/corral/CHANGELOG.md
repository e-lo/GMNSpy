# Changelog — corral

All notable changes to the `corral` package. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning is [Semver](https://semver.org/).

This file is for the **corral** package only. `netstead` (which depends on corral) keeps its own CHANGELOG at [`packages/netstead/CHANGELOG.md`](../netstead/CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

(Reserved for changes between the most recent release and the next.)

## [1.0.0-beta.2] — TBD

First release under the **corral** name (renamed from `datagrove` on
2026-10-05; import `corral`, PyPI distribution `dbcorral` because `corral`
is taken). Version bumped in lockstep with `netstead` v1.0.0-beta.2.

### Changed

- **BREAKING — DuckDB is the only compute engine** (#195). `PandasEngine` and
  `PolarsEngine` are removed, along with per-call `engine="pandas"|"polars"`.
  pandas / polars / pyarrow are I/O formats: frames come in through
  `from_arrow` / `from_records` and go out through `to_pandas()` / `to_polars()`.
  Rationale: [engine strategy ADR](../../docs/design/2026-10-01-engine-strategy-reevaluation.md).
- **Dependency floors raised** (#198): `ibis-framework[duckdb]>=10,<13`,
  `duckdb>=1.1`, `pyarrow>=17` (the old `ibis<10` pin is gone; `<13` added in #212).
- **Geometry is WKB in memory** (#201); CSV reads/writes WKT, Parquet stores WKB.
  [Geometry encoding ADR](../../docs/design/2026-10-01-geometry-encoding-adr.md).

### Fixed

- **Remote zips open through fsspec** (#216). A `.csv.zip` URL used to be
  opened as a local path relative to the working directory, so remote zips
  never worked and a URL containing `..` could read local files.
- **Local `.csv.zip` packages load** through `Package.from_source` (#211);
  members were mis-dispatched to the plain CSV adapter.
- **The shared DuckDB connection is serialized behind an engine lock** (#211),
  since it isn't thread-safe; `to_pandas` converts outside the lock (#212).
- Remote Parquet URLs are no longer mangled into local paths (#211).

### Added

- **GeoParquet `geo` metadata + bbox** on Parquet writes of WKB geometry
  columns (#202).

Test fixtures were also adjusted for the rebuilt Leavenworth fixture
(`netstead.fixtures.leavenworth` now covers the whole city polygon).

## [1.0.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-29

First public preview, tagged `datagrove-v1.0.0-beta.1` (pre-rename; never published to PyPI — names in this section are as tagged). This is a **beta**: API surface is stable enough to build against but we expect bug reports + small breaking changes before 1.0.0 GA.

### What this release covers

- Generic Frictionless Data Package engine with three interchangeable backends — ibis (DuckDB-backed; default), polars, pandas. Switch per call.
- I/O front door: `datagrove.read(source, *, engine=None, spec=None, ...)`. Auto-detects CSV / Parquet / DuckDB / zip-CSV from local paths or `s3://` / `https://` / `duckdb://` URLs.
- Four-pass validator returning a single `ValidationReport`: structural, schema, foreign-key, sync-state. Rich console / JSON / interactive single-file HTML output.
- Generic `editing/` framework with atomic rollback + audit log — used by `gmnspy.clean`.
- Spatial scope primitives in `datagrove.dataset.view`: `from_bbox` / `from_polygon` / `from_geometry_buffer`. Predicates push down to DuckDB SQL where possible.
- Self-hostable FastAPI primitives (`datagrove.api`) and MCP server primitives (`datagrove.mcp`) — assembled into concrete apps by gmnspy.
- Generic data-quality rule framework + entry-point plugin discovery.
- `datagrove` CLI (`validate`, `info`, `convert`) with `--json` on every command for agent / pipeline consumption.
- Cost-model gating on long operations with `--yes` / `DATAGROVE_AUTO_APPROVE=1` bypass for non-interactive use.
- AI artifacts: `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `ai/api-index.json` regenerate on every docs build.

### Architectural defaults

- Lazy by default. `Package.from_source(...)` returns a Package whose tables are unmaterialised ibis expressions until you `.collect()` / `.to_pandas()` / write.
- No raw SQL outside `datagrove.engines.ibis_engine` (enforced by `scripts/lint_no_sql.py` in CI).
- datagrove never imports gmnspy (enforced by `import-linter`).

### Notable fixes during beta-prep

- `PolarsEngine.from_records` now passes `infer_schema_length=None` so a column that is null for the first >100 rows and then carries a value (common with optional fields) infers correctly instead of raising `ComputeError` on append.

### Known limitations going into beta

- `Package.from_source()` mis-dispatches `.csv.zip` to the CSV adapter — use `csv_dir()` or `parquet_dir()` for now. Fix tracked.
- `datagrove.quality.run()` is named `run_quality()` — alias coming.
- HTML report renderer doesn't yet embed map view for geo-located issues.

### Compatibility

- Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13.
- Optional extras: `polars`, `pandas`, `s3`, `gcs`, `azure`, `keyring`, `mcp`.

### Migration from pre-1.0 GMNSpy

datagrove is a new package; nothing to migrate from. See [`packages/netstead/docs/migration/v0.3-to-v1.0.md`](../netstead/docs/migration/v0.3-to-v1.0.md) if you're moving from old GMNSpy.
