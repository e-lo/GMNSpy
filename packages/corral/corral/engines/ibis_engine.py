"""Ibis (duckdb-backed) execution engine — the default engine for corral.

This is the **only** module in the codebase permitted to embed raw SQL
strings; ``scripts/lint_no_sql.py`` allowlists this file. All other
modules must use ibis expressions (or call into this engine) to talk to
data. In practice the implementation below sticks to ibis-level
expressions and the backend's structured APIs (``create_table``,
``read_csv``, ``to_parquet``); the allowlist exists so that a deliberate
escape hatch is available if one is ever needed.

Default backend
---------------

``IbisEngine()`` constructs a fresh in-memory duckdb connection. Pass a
pre-opened backend (``IbisEngine(con=ibis.duckdb.connect("net.duckdb"))``)
to point at a file or share a connection. The engine owns one duckdb
connection for its lifetime; call ``close()`` to release it.

Thread safety
-------------

A duckdb connection is not safe to use from several threads at once: two
threads interleaving queries on it fail with "Attempting to execute an
unsuccessful or closed pending query result". Every ibis backend this module
creates or adopts is therefore *serialized*: each of its methods runs under one
re-entrant lock stored on the backend (see :func:`serialize_backend`). Locking
the backend, not just this class's methods, also covers code that executes an
expression directly (``expr.execute()``, ``expr.to_pandas()``), since those
calls go through the same backend object.

Per-thread ``con.cursor()`` connections are *not* an option: ibis's
``read_csv``/``read_parquet`` register temp views and :meth:`IbisEngine.materialize`
/ :meth:`IbisEngine.from_records` create temp tables, and duckdb temp objects
are private to the connection that created them, so another thread's cursor
cannot see them. Serializing costs little: duckdb already parallelizes a single
query across cores.

Remaining gaps (the lock wraps *method calls*, so anything that reaches the
duckdb connection outside one is not covered):

- batch readers returned by ``to_pyarrow_batches``/``to_pandas_batches`` are
  consumed after the call, and so the lock, has returned;
- ``_safe_raw_sql`` is a context manager: only entering it is locked, not the
  ``with`` body that uses its cursor; likewise the connection ``raw_sql``
  returns is used unlocked once the call returns (``backend.con`` itself, too:
  hold :func:`backend_lock` around direct use);
- properties that run queries (``current_database``, ``current_catalog``,
  ``version``, ``tables``) are not methods and are not wrapped;
- expressions bound to ibis's process-wide *default* backend (a plain
  ``ibis.memtable(...)`` with no engine) are not covered at all.

Corral's own code stays inside these lines (internal uses of the first three
happen inside an already-locked method); callers that step outside them should
take :func:`backend_lock`.

Dispatch model (post-issue-#134 inversion)
------------------------------------------

The engine exposes **per-format primitives** (``read_csv``,
``read_parquet``, ``read_duckdb_table``, ``from_records`` + the
matching ``write_*``). Adapters in :mod:`corral.io` call these
primitives directly. :meth:`scan` and :meth:`write` are thin
convenience methods that route format dispatch through
``corral.io.dispatch`` / ``corral.io.get_adapter`` — no per-format
if/elif lives in this module anymore.

The single carve-out in :meth:`scan` is dict sources: the dispatcher
can't sniff a ``{"data": ...}`` or ``{"format": "duckdb", ...}`` dict,
so :meth:`scan` short-circuits those two shapes and calls
:meth:`from_records` / :meth:`read_duckdb_table` directly before
handing the rest off to ``dispatch``.

            user who needs duckdb-specific extensions.
