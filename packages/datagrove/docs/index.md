# datagrove

A generic engine for tabular data packages in the [Frictionless](concepts/frictionless.md) format. Lazy by default, regional-scale ready, with composable primitives for validation, scope, editing, and serving.

## What problems datagrove solves

**Reading any Frictionless data package**, regardless of physical format, with one API surface:

```python
from datagrove import Package

pkg = Package.from_source("local/path/datapackage.json")      # local directory
pkg = Package.from_source("s3://bucket/path/datapackage.json")  # cloud, credentials cascade
pkg = Package.from_source("./mydata.duckdb")                    # single-file duckdb
pkg = Package.from_source("./mydata.csv.zip")                   # zipped CSV bundle
```

**Lazy evaluation at regional scale.** Tables aren't materialised until you ask. `pkg.tables["link"].filter(...).count()` pushes the count to DuckDB; only the integer comes back to Python.

**Engine choice without API rewrite.** The same `Package.from_source(...).validate()` works against ibis (default), pandas, or polars. Switch via `engine=` per call.

**Validation as a single report.** `pkg.validate()` returns one `ValidationReport` covering structural, schema, foreign-key, and sync-state checks. Severity-graded; rendered as rich console, JSON, or interactive HTML.

**Composable editing with rollback.** Open a `Session`, apply one or many edits, commit or roll back atomically. Persisted log as a sidecar parquet file.

**Generic surfaces** — CLI, FastAPI HTTP server, and MCP server — all reusable for any domain-specific spec that builds on datagrove (gmnspy being the canonical example).

## Use cases — when to install datagrove directly

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-truck-fast-outline:{ .lg .middle } &nbsp;**GTFS interop research**

    ---

    Building a GTFS ↔ GMNS bridge, or analysing GTFS feeds with the same toolchain you use for other tabular specs.

-   :material-file-cog-outline:{ .lg .middle } &nbsp;**Custom internal spec**

    ---

    Your organisation has a tabular data spec (sensor metadata, asset catalogs, planning datasets) that you want to validate, version, and serve consistently.

-   :material-cloud-outline:{ .lg .middle } &nbsp;**Cloud-resident data**

    ---

    Tables live in S3 / Azure Blob / GCS, and you want lazy SQL pushdown without writing the connection plumbing yourself.

-   :material-wrench-cog-outline:{ .lg .middle } &nbsp;**Building your own toolkit**

    ---

    You want the generic primitives (engine ABC, FormatAdapter registry, ValidationReport, Session, FastAPI helpers) to compose into a domain-specific package. gmnspy is the worked example.

## Why install datagrove

**It's small and focused.** Generic data-package primitives only — no domain semantics. Easy to reason about, easy to extend.

**Backend-agnostic.** ibis for SQL pushdown by default, pandas for compatibility, polars for fast in-memory. Add a backend by implementing the `Engine` protocol; no API rewrite.

**Production-grade defaults.** Bearer-token auth on the HTTP server by default. Warn-loudly on misconfiguration (e.g. `auth=none` + non-localhost bind). Cost-model gating on long operations with explicit approval semantics.

**Extension points are first-class.** `register_adapter` for new formats. `register_engine` for new backends. `register_rule` for quality rules. `extra_router_factory` for HTTP extensions. Same pattern across the surface.

## Install

Pick the tool you already use — these all produce the same install:

=== "uv (recommended)"

    ```bash
    uv add datagrove
    ```

    Fastest. Works inside a `uv`-managed project and writes to your `pyproject.toml` + `uv.lock`.

=== "uv pip"

    ```bash
    uv pip install datagrove
    ```

    Drop-in `pip` replacement. Use this in a plain `venv` without a project file.

=== "pip"

    ```bash
    pip install datagrove
    ```

    Classic. Works anywhere Python does.

=== "pipx"

    ```bash
    pipx install datagrove
    ```

    Isolated env for the `datagrove` CLI only — your project env stays untouched.

### Optional extras

The default install ships the ibis + DuckDB engine and Frictionless loader. Extras let you opt in to specific engines, cloud backends, and the AI surface:

| Extra | Pulls in | When you need it |
|---|---|---|
| `polars` | `polars>=1.0` | Use the polars engine for in-memory speed (see [engines decision guide](concepts/engines.md)) |
| `pandas` | `pandas>=2.2` | Use the pandas engine for DataFrame ergonomics |
| `s3` / `gcs` / `azure` | corresponding fsspec adapter | Read from cloud-storage URLs |
| `keyring` | `keyring>=24` | Resolve credentials from the system keychain |
| `mcp` | `mcp>=1.0` | Run `datagrove mcp serve` for Claude Desktop / Code |

Install with the same syntax (uv shown — substitute your tool):

```bash
uv add 'datagrove[polars,s3,keyring]'   # combine with commas
```

!!! tip "zsh users: quote the brackets"
    On **zsh** (the default shell on macOS), `[` and `]` are glob characters. Running `uv add datagrove[polars]` unquoted gives `zsh: no matches found: datagrove[polars]`. Always wrap the extras in quotes (`'datagrove[polars]'` or `"datagrove[polars]"`), or run `setopt no_nomatch` once per session to disable the check. bash users don't hit this.
