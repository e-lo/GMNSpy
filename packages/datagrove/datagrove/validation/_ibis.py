"""Internal: ibis wrap + shared helpers for the validators.

The validators in this package use ibis predicates throughout
(``expr[col].is_null()``, ``expr.filter(...).count().execute()``,
``expr.left_join(...)``) so that violation counts get pushed down to
the duckdb backend instead of materialising entire tables into
pandas. At Bay-Area scale (millions of rows) this is the difference
between "count nulls in a column" being a millisecond SQL aggregate
and being a gigabyte pandas materialisation.

To keep one codepath across the three engines, every validator entry
point calls :func:`to_ibis` once at the top, then operates on the
resulting :class:`ibis.expr.types.Table` for the rest of the call.

- ``IbisEngine`` (default) — pass-through. The expression already IS
  an ibis Table; we don't round-trip.
- ``PolarsEngine`` — collect the LazyFrame to a polars DataFrame, hand
  it the pyarrow Table view, wrap with ``ibis.memtable``. The data
  was going to be materialised anyway (polars is the in-memory path).
- ``PandasEngine`` — convert the DataFrame to pyarrow then
  ``ibis.memtable``. Same reasoning — pandas is already eager.

The ibis duckdb backend then runs all rule predicates as SQL against
the registered memtable. For pandas/polars sources this is a single
pyarrow round-trip per validator orchestrator call (not per rule), so
the overhead is bounded.

Sample materialisation for Issue enumeration goes via ``.to_pyarrow()``
+ ``.to_pylist()`` — never pandas — so this module is pandas-free.

This module is *also* the single home for the small ibis-shaped
helpers every validator needs (row-index attach, push-down count,
sample-as-pylist, source-row recovery, summary-issue builder). The
``schema_check`` and ``foreign_keys`` modules used to keep their own
copies; consolidating them here removes a ~70-LOC duplication and
gives the validator authors one obvious place to look.
