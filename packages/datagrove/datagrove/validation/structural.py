"""Structural validation — does the source actually have the tables the spec declares?

This is the cheapest validation pass: no row reads, no schema parsing,
just a list-vs-list compare between

    * ``package.resources`` — the spec's declared resources, "what
      should be at the source", and
    * the :class:`~datagrove.io.base.ResourceListing` returned by a
      :class:`~datagrove.io.base.FormatAdapter.scan` call — "what's
      actually there".

Every discrepancy becomes one :class:`~datagrove.validation.Issue` with
``category=Category.STRUCTURAL`` and a stable dotted ``code``:

* ``structural.missing_required_resource`` — ERROR. Spec marks the
  resource as required and the scan didn't find it.
* ``structural.missing_optional_resource`` — INFO. Spec marks the
  resource as optional and the scan didn't find it. Informational only.
* ``structural.unexpected_resource`` — WARNING. Scan found a resource
  the spec doesn't declare. Could be a legal extension; could be a typo.
* ``structural.missing_file`` — ERROR. Spec declares a resource at a
  ``path`` and that path is not present at the source.

**Required vs. optional policy (opt-in required).** Frictionless does
not authoritatively define the semantics of the ``required`` field on
a :class:`~datagrove.spec.model.Resource`. We treat it as a positive
assertion:

    * ``required=True``   → required (ERROR if missing)
    * ``required=False``  → explicitly optional (INFO if missing)
    * ``required=None`` (omitted) → **treated as optional** (INFO if missing)

The reason this is opt-in rather than opt-out: GMNS 0.97's
``datapackage.json`` declares ``required: true`` on exactly the link
and node resources and omits the field on all others — the
straightforward read of that is "everything else is optional". A
default-required policy would flag every unused optional GMNS table as
an ERROR when validating against the canonical GMNS spec, which is
clearly wrong. This same policy is the natural one for any other
Frictionless package that follows the GMNS convention.

If a downstream caller wants stricter behaviour ("any declared
resource must be present"), it can iterate the report and re-categorise
``structural.missing_optional_resource`` to ERROR — the codes are
stable for exactly this kind of policy layering.

The companion :func:`check_structural_from_source` is a one-call
wrapper that takes a source + a spec, runs the adapter's
:meth:`~datagrove.io.base.FormatAdapter.scan` for you, and threads the
result into :func:`check_structural`. It also handles the (common!)
case of a *directory of csvs* / *directory of parquet files* — a
shape that no single :class:`~datagrove.io.base.FormatAdapter` owns
because the directory itself has no extension to dispatch on.

Examples:
    Synthetic spec missing one required table::

        >>> from datagrove.spec.model import DataPackage, Resource
        >>> from datagrove.io.base import ResourceRef
        >>> from datagrove.validation.structural import check_structural
        >>> pkg = DataPackage(
        ...     name="demo",
        ...     resources=[
        ...         Resource(name="link", path="link.csv", required=True),
        ...         Resource(name="node", path="node.csv", required=True),
        ...     ],
        ... )
        >>> actual = [ResourceRef(name="node", path="node.csv", format="csv")]
        >>> r = check_structural(pkg, source="syn", actual_resources=actual)
        >>> r.has_errors
        True
        >>> "structural.missing_required_resource" in {i.code for i in r.issues}
        True
