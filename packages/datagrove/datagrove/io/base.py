"""FormatAdapter protocol, source/resource types, and exception hierarchy.

This module defines the contract every storage-format adapter must satisfy
(csv, parquet, duckdb, zipcsv, remote-fsspec, ...). Concrete adapters live
in sibling modules and are expected to be registered via
``datagrove.io.register_adapter`` at import time of their host module.

Design notes for adapter implementers:
    - ``probe`` must be cheap (header sniff / magic-byte check / extension
      heuristic). It is called by the dispatcher only as a last resort,
      after explicit ``format=``, URL scheme, and filename extension
      dispatch have failed.
    - ``read`` must return a *lazy* table expression created via the engine
      (e.g., ``engine.read_csv(path)``); it must not materialize.
    - ``scan`` is the discovery surface for multi-table containers
      (a directory of csvs, a duckdb file with multiple tables, a zip with
      multiple csvs). Single-table formats simply return a one-element list.
    - The engine reference is passed through so adapters can defer all
      actual I/O to the engine's native readers --this keeps adapters thin
      and engine-agnostic at the call site.
