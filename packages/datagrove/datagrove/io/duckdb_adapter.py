"""DuckDB FormatAdapter — multi-table .duckdb files + ``duckdb://`` URLs.

DuckDB is the **default API-download format** per ``docs/architecture.md``
§6.1: a single self-contained file with all tables of a network bundled
together, plus the ``_gmnspy_meta.json`` sidecar. This adapter is the
on-ramp for every API consumer.

What's different from csv/parquet adapters
------------------------------------------

DuckDB files are **multi-table containers** — one file holds N tables.
That has two consequences:

1. ``scan()`` is a real enumeration step (it returns N ``ResourceRef``s,
   one per table). Callers can't just open the file blindly and read
   "the data" the way a single-csv read works.
2. ``read()`` and ``write()`` require a ``table=`` kwarg. Without it
   they raise :class:`InvalidEngineCallError` with a hint to call
   ``scan()`` first to list the tables.

No raw SQL here
---------------

Per the architecture's hard rule, only ``datagrove.engines.ibis_engine``
is allowed to embed raw SQL strings. We follow the rule rigidly:

* Table enumeration uses ``duckdb.connect(...).table_function('duckdb_tables')``
  — duckdb exposes its system catalogue as a relation, so we read a
  relation and filter in Python rather than running ``SHOW TABLES``.
* Reads and writes delegate to the engine via the cross-engine
  ``{"format": "duckdb", "path": ..., "table": ...}`` source-dict
  contract. The polars and pandas engines both use the duckdb Python
  relation API (``con.table(name).pl()`` / ``con.table(name).df()``)
  to satisfy that contract without SQL; the ibis engine uses its
  duckdb backend. This adapter does not need to know which is which —
  it just hands the dict to the engine.

URL scheme
----------

``duckdb://path/to/file.duckdb`` is parsed as a sub-locator alias for
``path/to/file.duckdb``. The scheme is useful for the remote/cache
flows that the API-download path will lean on (task 1.11): a URL is
the unambiguous form for "fetch this duckdb and open it".
