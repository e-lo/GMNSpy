"""Engine protocol + supporting types for the datagrove engine layer.

An ``Engine`` is the *execution* abstraction over a Frictionless tabular
data package. It exposes a set of **per-format read/write primitives**
(``read_csv``, ``read_parquet``, ``read_duckdb_table``, ``from_records``,
``write_csv``, ``write_parquet``, ``write_duckdb_table``) plus a
``cast_schema`` helper. ``scan`` and ``write`` are thin convenience
methods that delegate format routing to the
:class:`~datagrove.io.FormatAdapter` registry.

Concrete engines (one per file in this package) implement this protocol:

- ``IbisEngine`` (default; backed by duckdb) — ``TableExpr`` is
  ``ibis.expr.types.Table``.
- ``PolarsEngine`` — ``TableExpr`` is ``polars.LazyFrame``.
- ``PandasEngine`` — ``TableExpr`` is ``pandas.DataFrame`` (eager;
  pandas has no lazy mode).

The protocol is **structural** (``typing.Protocol``,
``runtime_checkable``). The exact concrete types of ``TableExpr`` and
``NativeFrame`` differ per engine — that is intentional. Generic code
that hands an expression back to the same engine that produced it does
not need to care; cross-engine flow goes through the
``to_pandas`` / ``to_polars`` converters.

Dispatch model (single source of truth)
---------------------------------------

After issue #134 (the engine/adapter inversion), format dispatch lives
in exactly one place — the :class:`~datagrove.io.FormatAdapter` registry.

- ``Adapter.read(source, engine, ...)`` calls the engine's matching
  **primitive** (``engine.read_csv``, ``engine.read_parquet``,
  ``engine.read_duckdb_table``, ``engine.from_records``). No
  engine-name dispatch inside adapters.
- ``Engine.scan(source, format=None, ...)`` is a 3-line convenience
  that resolves ``source`` via ``datagrove.io.dispatch`` and delegates
  to the chosen adapter's ``read``. It exists so callers who don't want
  to think about adapters can just say ``engine.scan(path)``.

The inversion means an engine never owns a per-format if/elif ladder
and adapters never name engines; both can grow independently.

class Engine(Protocol):
    """Execution engine for tabular operations on a Frictionless data package.

    Implementations are concrete classes (one per backend: ibis, polars,
    pandas) that satisfy this protocol structurally. The registry
    (``datagrove.engines``) holds singleton instances and resolves them
    by ``name``.

    The contract has three layers:

    1. **Per-format primitives** (``read_csv`` / ``read_parquet`` /
       ``read_duckdb_table`` / ``from_records`` / their write
       counterparts). Adapters call these directly. An engine that
       doesn't natively support a primitive (e.g.
       :class:`~datagrove.engines.polars_engine.PolarsEngine.write_duckdb_table`)
       raises :class:`~datagrove.engines.errors.EngineNotAvailableError`
       with a clear pointer at the engine that does.
    2. **Schema casting** (``cast_schema``). Promoted from a per-engine
       internal helper so adapters can apply Frictionless schema casts
       uniformly after a primitive read.
    3. **Convenience delegators** (``scan`` / ``write``). 3-line
       wrappers that route through ``datagrove.io.dispatch``. They exist
       so callers who don't care about adapters can still write
       ``engine.scan(path)``.

    Attributes:
        name: Short identifier used as the registry key
            (``"ibis"`` / ``"polars"`` / ``"pandas"``).

          matplotlib, geopandas pre-1.0) that don't understand
          ``pd.ArrowDtype`` columns.
