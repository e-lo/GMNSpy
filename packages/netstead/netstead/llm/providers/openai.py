#: A reasoning model's token cap includes its hidden reasoning tokens, so the default 1024-token
#: budget (:class:`~netstead.llm.types.CompletionRequest`) often leaves nothing for the visible
#: reply: HTTP 200, empty content, ``finish_reason="length"``. Raised to this floor for those
#: models only; a caller asking for more already gets what it asked for (see ``complete``).
_REASONING_MIN_MAX_TOKENS = 8192

#: Reasoning-tier model id prefixes that reject ``max_tokens`` (use ``max_completion_tokens`` instead)
#: and reject a non-default ``temperature``. All confirmed as reasoning models on their respective
#: pages under https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/ (checked 2026-10-05): o1, o3, o4-mini,
#: gpt-5, and the GPT-6 generation (gpt-6-luna, gpt-6.1-sol, gpt-6-astra all say "Is this a reasoning
#: model? Yes" / list reasoning-token support).
_REASONING_PREFIXES = ("o1", "o3", "o4", "gpt-5", "gpt-6")

#: Reasoning model id prefixes whose docs confirm Chat Completions' function/tool calling only works
#: with ``reasoning_effort`` (Chat Completions key) / ``reasoning.effort`` (Responses key) set to
#: ``"none"``. Checked 2026-10-05 against the model pages at
#: https://developers.openai.com/api/docs/models/<id>:
#:   - gpt-6-luna: "reasoning.effort supports none, low, medium (default), high, xhigh, and max." and
#:     "Chat Completions supports function calling only with reasoning_effort set to none." -> send it.
#:   - gpt-6.1-sol: "reasoning.effort supports low, medium (default), high, xhigh, and max." (no
#:     "none") and "Chat Completions is supported without tool calling." -> tool calls aren't available
#:     on this model via Chat Completions at all, with or without reasoning_effort, so "none" would just
#:     be rejected; don't send it.
#:   - gpt-6-astra: "reasoning.effort supports low, medium, high, xhigh, and max." (no "none");
#:     function_calling is listed as a supported Chat Completions feature with no reasoning_effort
#:     caveat, so tool calls work at the default effort -> don't send it.
#:   - gpt-5: "reasoning.effort supports minimal, low, medium, and high." (no "none"); function_calling
#:     is listed with no reasoning_effort caveat -> don't send it.
#:   - o1, o3, o4-mini: no reasoning_effort values documented on the model page at all (these predate
#:     GPT-5/6's effort tiers); nothing suggests "none" is accepted -> don't send it.
#: Only gpt-6-luna is covered today; add a prefix here only once a model's own docs state the same
#: "none"-for-tool-calling requirement.
