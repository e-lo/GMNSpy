"""Decode a link-geometry cell (WKT ``str`` **or** WKB ``bytes``) to a shapely geometry.

The binary-geometry migration (geometry ADR, 2026-10-01) makes WKB bytes the
canonical in-memory encoding, but CSV-sourced data still arrives as WKT text and
older callers may hold either. The shapely-dependent consumers (``clean``,
``indexes.spatial``, ``quality.rules``, ``scope``) need full shapely geometries
— for ``STRtree`` / ``simplify`` / ``length`` / ``unary_union`` — not just the
coordinate pairs that the dep-free :func:`netstead._wkt.linestring_points` yields.
This one helper lets every such site accept both encodings without each
re-implementing the dispatch.

``shapely`` is imported lazily inside the function: callers are already
shapely-gated (it ships in the ``clean`` extra), and keeping the import out of
module scope means ``import netstead._geom`` stays cheap and dependency-free.
