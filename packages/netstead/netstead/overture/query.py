"""Area resolution + Overture GeoParquet reading via DuckDB (the only I/O module).

This is the only module in :mod:`netstead.overture` that touches external data. It
turns a user-supplied area into an EPSG:4326 bbox, reads the Overture
**transportation** theme (``segment`` + ``connector`` types) straight from
GeoParquet with DuckDB, pushes the bbox + ``class`` predicates down into
``read_parquet`` (so only matching rows cross the wire), and returns the plain
``(segments, connectors)`` records :mod:`netstead.overture.convert` consumes.

Overture stores geometry as WKB in GeoParquet (surfaced by duckdb spatial either
as raw WKB or, for current releases, as a native GEOMETRY column); following the official DuckDB
recipe, geometry is turned into WKT / coordinates with the duckdb **spatial**
extension via ibis builtin-UDF wrappers (no raw SQL — the whole pipeline stays
engine-consistent). Remote ``s3://`` reads additionally need the **httpfs**
extension.

Conventions:
    * **bbox** is ``(west, south, east, north)`` in EPSG:4326.
    * a **point** is ``(lat, lon)`` (osmnx / OSM-source convention).
    * a **place** is a free-text string resolved through the OSM source's
      Nominatim geocoder (lazy import; needs the ``[osm]`` extra).

"© OpenStreetMap contributors, © Overture Maps Foundation" in derived products

it does not vendor or redistribute it.
