"""Orchestration: read Overture -> convert -> assemble a GMNS :class:`Network`.

:func:`build_network_from_overture` is the public entry point for the whole
pipeline (area resolution + Overture GeoParquet read + segment/connector
conversion + Network assembly). Its signature mirrors
:func:`netstead.osm.build.build_network_from_osm` as closely as the data model
allows, so a user can swap ``from_osm`` -> ``from_overture`` and keep the same
call in the common case. Source-specific keyword args (HTTP-fetch concerns for
OSM; object-store read concerns for Overture) differ, but the shared
``area`` / ``buffer_m`` / ``network_type`` / ``extra_tags`` / ``spec_version`` /
``engine`` surface is identical.

Records assembly is delegated to the shared, source-agnostic
:func:`netstead._network_build.network_from_records` (the same helper the OSM
source uses), stamping ``overture_export`` on the generated ``config`` table.

and does not vendor it.

    Args:
        area: A place string, a ``(lat, lon)`` point, or a
            ``(west, south, east, north)`` bbox. (Place strings are geocoded via
            the OSM source's Nominatim helper and need the ``[osm]`` extra.)
        buffer_m: Buffer in metres applied when ``area`` is a point.
        network_type: One of ``drive``/``walk``/``bike``/``all`` (filters on
            Overture ``class``; see ``overture_network_filters.yaml``).
        extra_tags: Extra Overture segment property paths (dotted, e.g.
            ``"subclass"`` / ``"road_surface"``) to carry onto each link as
            columns. Same purpose as the OSM source's ``extra_tags``, with
            Overture property names instead of OSM tag keys.
        spec_version: GMNS spec version (default :data:`netstead.spec.DEFAULT_SPEC`).
        engine: Compute engine to materialise through (default: corral
            ibis/duckdb).
        overture_release: Pinned Overture release string (ignored when
            ``data_root`` is set). Bump to move releases reproducibly.
        data_root: Override base URI for the data (Azure mirror or a local
            snapshot directory holding ``segment.parquet`` / ``connector.parquet``).

    Returns:
        A populated :class:`~netstead.network.Network` (nodes + links with WKT
        geometry, carrying ``name`` / ``ref`` and Overture provenance columns,
        plus a ``config`` table declaring CRS + units).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If no segments match ``network_type`` in the area, or a
            referenced connector is missing.
