"""GMNS data-quality rule pack — entry-point registered into :mod:`corral.quality`.

Re-exports the rule classes + the :func:`register_all` factory wired
as the ``corral.quality.rules`` entry point for the ``netstead``
distribution (see ``packages/netstead/pyproject.toml``).

Once :mod:`corral.quality` runs entry-point discovery on its first
:func:`~corral.quality.run_quality` call, every rule in this module
becomes available via ``corral.quality.list_rules()`` and runs
against any GMNS :class:`Network` passed to ``run_quality(net)``.

Direct invocation (without the entry-point dance) is supported for
tests + ad-hoc scripts:

    >>> from netstead.quality import register_all
    >>> rules = register_all()
    >>> len(rules) >= 7
    True
