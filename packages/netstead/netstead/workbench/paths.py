"""Local-path policy for the workbench: every local read or write stays under ``io.allowed_roots``.

An empty ``io.allowed_roots`` means "the user's home directory". Paths are
resolved (``~`` expanded, symlinks followed, ``..`` collapsed) *before* the
containment check, so neither a symlink nor a ``..`` segment can escape a root.
Only remote URLs (corral's :data:`~corral.io.remote.REMOTE_SCHEMES`: http(s), s3, gs/gcs,
az/abfs(s)) skip the check. ``duckdb://<path>`` and ``file://<path>`` are local paths in disguise
and are checked like any other; every other scheme, and fsspec ``::`` chains, are rejected.
:func:`classify_source` is the one entry point for "a source string the user typed".
