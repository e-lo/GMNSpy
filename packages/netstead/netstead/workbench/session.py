"""Workbench session: the one place state changes, via :meth:`Session.dispatch`.

UI clicks (``POST /api/actions``), Python (``session.dispatch(...)``), and, in
P3, the NL assistant all funnel through ``dispatch``. Each call is recorded as a
:class:`HistoryEntry` carrying its ``to_python`` replay snippet, and publishes
``history`` + ``state`` events for the browser. Network *edits* are not actions
here yet: in P2 they become ProjectCard-shaped ``NetworkChange`` objects.

Actions marked ``runs_as_job`` (``OpenNetwork``, ``BuildNetwork``) do their slow
work on a background job thread *without* the session lock. :meth:`Session.submit`
starts one and returns immediately (the HTTP path); :meth:`Session.dispatch` starts
one and waits (Python, the CLI), so callers see the same blocking behaviour as before.

A successful job ends in :meth:`Session._commit`, which registers the loaded network
*and* records its history entry in one critical section. History order therefore
always matches registry order, even when two jobs overlap, so replaying the history
reproduces the same network ids. Failed and cancelled jobs are recorded by
:meth:`Session._finish`.

``Select`` with an utterance may call a language model, which can take seconds. Its parse
(:meth:`Session._prepare_select`) runs *before* the lock is taken; the handler then applies the
outcome and records it under the lock, failing if the network was closed or changed meanwhile.
Provider failures (keys, quotas, timeouts) are recorded :class:`ActionError` results, never a
silent fallback to another provider.
