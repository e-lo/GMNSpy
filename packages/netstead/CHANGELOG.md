# Changelog — netstead

All notable changes to the `netstead` package. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versioning is [Semver](https://semver.org/).

This file is for the **netstead** package only. The underlying generic engine `corral` keeps its own CHANGELOG at [`packages/corral/CHANGELOG.md`](../corral/CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

(Reserved for changes between the most recent release and the next.)

## [1.0.0-beta.2] — TBD

First release under the **netstead** name. The package was renamed from
`gmnspy` (and its engine from `datagrove` to `corral`, PyPI dist `dbcorral`)
on 2026-10-05; `import gmnspy` → `import netstead`, `gmnspy <cmd>` →
`netstead <cmd>`. The `gmnspy` name on PyPI stays frozen at the v0.3.x line
(the 1.0.0b1 preview below was yanked).

Second public preview. The big theme: the **Workbench** (`netstead app`), one
local front end to open or build a network, select parts of it in plain
language, and inspect it on a linked map and table. Also new: an embeddable
map with an **edit log** for triaging findings and replaying the fixes in Python.

### Added

- **Workbench — `netstead app`** (#211, #212). A local web app over one typed
  Action bus (`Session.dispatch`) with history and "copy as Python", live
  updates over SSE, background jobs and a network registry. Front end is
  no-build ES modules on MapLibre + deck.gl.
  - **Open / Import wizard:** open local or remote networks, or build one from
    OSM or Overture by drawn or typed bbox or place search. A server-side file
    browser is confined to `io.allowed_roots`; builds estimated over 90 s ask
    for approval.
  - **Settings dialog** generated from the settings schema; each value shows
    its source (default / user / project / env / session) and saves to the
    layer you pick. Settings themselves are layered (`netstead.config`).
  - **Linked map and table:** a map click scrolls to the row, a row click
    flies the map, an FK cell jumps to the referenced row. Scope menu: All /
    Selection / Highlighted / Related.
  - **FK related records** from the spec's foreign keys, computed in DuckDB and
    tinted on the map and in other tables.
  - Cookbook: `workbench.md`.
- **Multi-provider natural-language selection** (`[nl]` extra, #211).
  Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini or a local Ollama model through hand-rolled
  `httpx` adapters (no vendor SDKs). API keys come only from environment
  variables or the OS keyring and never appear in settings, history, logs or
  responses. Network vocabulary goes only to local endpoints unless you opt
  in. Local Ollama works with no configuration. New `netstead llm`
  commands: `status`, `set-key`, `remove-key`, `test`, `models`, `pull`.
  Cookbook: `local-llm-ollama.md`.
- **`netstead.select` — natural-language selection** (#194). Turns an utterance
  like *"I-40 EB between Harrison Ave and NC 54"* into a validated, repeatable
  set of GMNS `link_id`s via in-network topological traversal (no geocoding).
  `netstead select` CLI. Selection falls back between a facility's `ref` and
  `name` when one misses.
- **`netstead.viz` — binary render buffers, styling and paged DuckDB table
  access** (#194) used by the Workbench: deck.gl layers fed from Parquet without
  GeoJSON, attribute styling, and paged / sorted / filtered table reads.
- **`netstead.overture` + `netstead build --source overture`** (#196) — build a
  GMNS network from Overture Maps, mirroring the OSM pipeline. Behind the
  `[overture]` extra.
- **`netstead.bench` benchmark harness** (#197) — time + peak memory for
  network build, selection and viz packing, with a programmatic API alongside
  the CLI.
- **`netstead.map` module** — embeddable interactive network viewer.
  - `NetworkMap` — reusable component class. Any host page (validation
    report, notebook, custom dashboard) can include shared head assets
    (`NetworkMap.head_assets()`) once and drop in one or more per-instance
    body fragments (`instance.body_fragment()`). Each instance carries a
    UID so multiple maps coexist on one page.
  - `NetworkMap.to_html()` — full standalone HTML doc.
  - `NetworkMap._repr_html_()` — iframe-isolated Jupyter render.
  - `netstead.map.render_network_html(net, issues=None, ...)` — thin
    convenience over `NetworkMap.to_html()`.
  - `netstead.map.render_validation_html(net, report, ...)` — full
    validation report page composing a NetworkMap with the findings
    table.
  - Toggleable layers (links, nodes; extensible for zones / segments /
    movements). Hover tooltips on every element show its GMNS row
    columns. Popups on findings carry `Fix locally` / `Fix upstream
    (OSM) →` / `Show error in table`.
- **Edit log Phase 1** — `netstead.map.edits`:
  - `Edit`, `EditLog`, `AppliedEdit`, `SkippedEdit`, `ApplyResult`
    dataclasses.
  - `load_edit_log(path)` / `dump_edit_log(log, path)` — YAML round-trip.
  - `apply_edits(net, log) → ApplyResult` — deterministic replay with
    PK-indexed row lookup, drift check (`from_value` vs current), and
    per-edit `skipped` reasons.
  - **On-disk format is `network-wrangler` ProjectCard.** Each session
    serialises to a single ProjectCard with `changes[]` of
    `roadway_property_change` entries. GMNS `link_id` maps to
    `model_link_id` in the facility selector; per-cell values live under
    `property_changes.<column>.{existing, set}`. Node property changes
    emit with the same shape via `model_node_id` (netstead extension —
    standard ProjectCard has no first-class node-property-change type).
- **CLI output flags** on `netstead validate`:
  - `--html` writes the new map+table viewer (gracefully falls back to
    the corral table-only HTML when `[reports]` is missing, so
    `--html` always produces a file).
  - `--csv` writes a flat findings table.
  - `--xlsx` writes a single-sheet workbook (requires `[reports]`).
- **`netstead.osm` deep-link helpers** — `osm_edit_url(osm_id, *, kind,
  editor)`, `issue_osm_edit_url(issue, network, *, editor)`. Now
  detection is column-based (`osm_way_id` on link, `osm_node_id` on
  node), so ANY network carrying those columns gets Edit-in-OSM
  links — regardless of whether it was built via `netstead.osm.build`.
- **Bundled Leavenworth fixture rebuilt.** Built from the full OSM city
  polygon via `osmnx.graph_from_place("Leavenworth, Washington, USA")`
  instead of a 600m centroid buffer. Every link row now carries
  `osm_way_id`, every node row `osm_node_id`, so Edit-in-OSM works on
  the bundled fixture out of the box.
  - Row counts: node 75 → 121, link 214 → 339, lane 280 → 429.
  - Total fixture size ~700KB → ~2.7MB (still under the 5MB wheel cap).
- **New cookbook recipes**:
  - `view-your-network.md` — the standalone map, no validation.
  - `fix-findings.md` — the full triage → YAML → apply → save flow.

### Changed

- **`netstead viz` and `netstead select-serve` open the Workbench** (#212). The
  standalone viewer and selection prototype apps they used to start are removed.
- **`[server]` requires `fastapi>=0.132`**, whose strict JSON content-type
  handling the Workbench's request guard relies on.
- **Geometry is WKB in memory** (#201). CSV stays WKT on disk; Parquet stores
  WKB with GeoParquet `geo` metadata (#202).
- **DuckDB is the only compute engine** (via corral, #195). `engine="pandas"` /
  `engine="polars"` are gone; pandas / polars / Arrow are I/O formats.
- **`netstead.osm.__init__` is now lazy.** Importing the package no longer
  eagerly requires the `[osm]` extra. `osm_edit_url` /
  `issue_osm_edit_url` are dep-free helpers and load without
  `requests` / `pyyaml`. `build_network_from_osm` /
  `network_from_records` still need `[osm]` and surface the same
  helpful `ImportError`.
- **`[reports]` extra now includes `pyyaml>=6`** for the edit-log
  YAML round-trip.

### Deprecated

- `netstead.reports.render_network_html` / `render_validation_html` —
  moved to `netstead.map`. The old imports still work via re-export but
  emit a `DeprecationWarning`. `netstead.reports.write_findings_csv` /
  `write_findings_xlsx` stay put.

### Known limitations

- `netstead app --host 0.0.0.0` with an empty `io.allowed_roots` lets anyone on
  the network browse your home directory. Keep the default loopback host, or
  set `io.allowed_roots`.
- The default local model (`qwen3:4b`) has not been tested live; `qwen2.5:7b`
  has.

### Known limitations (edit log)

- Edit log only supports `kind: fix` (per-cell value changes). Row
  additions, row deletions, and schema changes are deferred. The YAML
  format reserves ProjectCard `kind: modification` for future use.
- No bulk-fix UI in the browser — bulk fixes go through Python
  directly.
- The map's marker layer has no clustering; past ~5k markers Leaflet
  will slow.

## [1.0.0-beta.1] — 2026-06-29

First public preview of GMNSpy v1.0, published to PyPI as `gmnspy==1.0.0b1` (pre-rename, since yanked; names in this section are as shipped). The entire codebase is a rewrite from v0.3.5 — there is no in-place upgrade path; see the [migration guide](docs/migration/v0.3-to-v1.0.md).

This is a **beta**: API surface is stable enough to build against and most user-facing rough edges have been smoothed, but we expect bug reports + small breaking changes before 1.0.0 GA.

### Headline changes vs v0.3.x

- **New architecture.** GMNS-specific code now sits on top of a generic Frictionless engine ([`datagrove`](https://github.com/e-lo/netstead/tree/main/packages/corral) (now `corral`)) shipped as a separate PyPI package. The intent: future spec toolkits (GTFSpy, etc.) reuse the engine.
- **Multi-version GMNS support out of the box.** Spec versions `0.95`, `0.96`, `0.97` ship side-by-side. `DEFAULT_SPEC = "0.97"`. Override per call: `gmnspy.read(..., spec_version="0.96")`.
- **Regional-scale performance.** Lazy ibis + DuckDB by default. Predicates push down to SQL. Validation and scope operations stream rather than materialising the whole network.
- **Three usage modes, one core.** CLI (`gmnspy <command>`), notebook (`Network._repr_html_`), and programmatic (`gmnspy.read`, `gmnspy.validate`) all share the same underlying objects.

### New features

- **`gmnspy.read(source)`** + **`gmnspy.validate(source)`** — the documented I/O front door. Accepts paths / URLs / loaded Networks.
- **`Network.from_source()`** with multi-version spec auto-load.
- **`gmnspy validate`** CLI with `--html <path>` for interactive single-file reports + `--spec` for version override.
- **`gmnspy quality`** — data-quality rule pack beyond spec compliance: high-speed-on-residential, disconnected components, lane-count mismatch, sharp-angle bends, implausible v/c, etc. Plugin-extensible via the `datagrove.quality.rules` entry point.
- **`gmnspy.scope`** — network-aware scope ops: `from_nodes`, `from_node`, `from_link`, `from_point`, `connected_component`, `from_zone`. Chainable. Returns a scoped `Network` with FK chain pre-filtered.
- **`gmnspy.osm` + `gmnspy build` CLI** — build a validated GMNS network from OpenStreetMap for a bounding box, place name (city/county), or a lat/lon point + buffer. Hand-rolled Overpass + Nominatim access (no `osmnx` / `osm2gmns` dependency); maintained tag-mapping data files; produces a self-describing network with a `config` table declaring units. Behind the `gmnspy[osm]` extra (`requests`, `pyyaml`).
- **`gmnspy.graph` + `gmnspy[graph]` extra** — scipy-CSR routing engine: connectivity (weak / strong components), isochrones, shortest paths, multi-source distance buffer, nearest-node snap. Builds from a `Network` or directly from parquet/duckdb/polars/in-memory sources. This is also the unified backend powering `gmnspy.semantics` + `gmnspy.scope` connectivity / network-distance ops (replacing the older `igraph`-based index).
- **`gmnspy[clean]` extra** — network editing with atomic rollback (`simplify_geometry`, `merge_close_nodes`, `remove_orphans`, `recompute_lengths`). Every edit returns an `EditResult` with diff + log entry; sessions stored as sidecar parquet.
- **`gmnspy[server]` extra** — self-hostable FastAPI server (`gmnspy server run`). Pluggable bearer-token auth. Ships `Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.example.yml`.
- **`gmnspy[mcp]` extra** — MCP server (`gmnspy mcp serve`) exposing read / describe / query / scope / validate / quality_check / edit_session tools to Claude Desktop / Claude Code.
- **`gmnspy[notebook]` extra** — interactive scope-builder ipywidget. (Basic `_repr_html_` ships in core.)
- **`gmnspy doctor`** — install diagnostic: Python version, extras installed, vendored specs, fixture loads, env vars.
- **`gmnspy bench`** — read/validate/connectivity timing.
- **Bundled Leavenworth, WA fixture** in four storage variants (CSV / parquet / DuckDB / zip-CSV) — see [`fixtures/leavenworth/README.md`](netstead/fixtures/leavenworth/README.md) for provenance.

### AI surface

- **`--json` on every CLI command** for tool-call loops.
- **`llms.txt` + `llms-full.txt` + `ai/api-index.json`** auto-generated from docs + docstrings.
- **Five Claude Code Skills** in [`skills/`](../../skills/) — `datagrove-validate`, `gmns-author`, `gmns-validate`, `gmns-convert`, `gmns-clean`.

### Internal architecture

- **Single graph backend.** All connectivity + network-aware-scope ops (`gmnspy.semantics.connectivity`, `gmnspy.scope`, `gmnspy.quality.rules` disconnected-components, `Network.build_indexes(graph=True)`) now run on a shared `gmnspy.graph.GMNSGraph` (scipy CSR), cached once per network. The earlier `gmnspy.indexes.GraphIndex` (igraph) wrapper is retired; the `igraph` dependency is dropped (`[clean]` no longer pulls it in). `SpatialIndex` (STRtree) is unaffected.

### Quality + process

- 1285 tests passing; coverage ≥ 85% on each package (gated in CI).
- Two automated contract tests assert every documented `gmnspy.X` / `datagrove.X` symbol AND every documented `gmnspy <cmd> --flag` actually exists — prevents doc-vs-code drift.
- Per-package CI matrix (Python 3.11 / 3.12 / 3.13 × Linux / macOS), import-linter contracts, raw-SQL lint, doctest-modules sweep, htmlproofer.

### Breaking changes from v0.3.x

**Everything.** v1.0 is a clean rewrite — no `_legacy/` shims, no DeprecationWarning bridges. The [migration guide](docs/migration/v0.3-to-v1.0.md) maps the old API surface to the new. The biggest moves:

- `gmnspy.read_gmns_network(path)` → `gmnspy.read(path)` (auto-detects format) or `Network.from_source(path)`.
- `gmnspy.schema.read_schema(path)` → `gmnspy.load_gmns_spec(version="0.97")`.
- All single-file imports under `gmnspy.{schema,validation,utils}` → moved to `datagrove.spec`, `datagrove.validation`, `datagrove.utils.markdown`.
- Pandas DataFrames are no longer the lingua franca — operations are lazy ibis expressions; call `.to_pandas()` / `.to_polars()` at the boundary.

### Known limitations going into beta

- `gmnspy.bench` is CLI-only — no programmatic API yet (tracked for v1.1).
- HTML report doesn't yet embed a Vega-Lite map view for geo-located issues.
- `gmnspy.clean` lacks `split_link_at_node` and `snap_to_reference` (tracked for v1.1).

### Compatibility

- Python 3.11, 3.12, 3.13.
- macOS + Linux (Windows community-supported only; CI doesn't cover it).
- Optional extras: `osm`, `graph`, `clean`, `server`, `mcp`, `notebook`, `all`.
