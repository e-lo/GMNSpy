# Edit a network with atomic rollback

## When to use this

You're applying a destructive, geometry-aware cleanup to a network — merge near-coincident nodes, drop orphan nodes, simplify link geometry, recompute lengths — and you want a safety net. The `gmnspy.clean` ops run inside a `Session` that records every change, so you can undo all of them in LIFO order: by raising inside the `with` block, by calling `session.rollback()`, or by replaying a persisted log later.

These ops are the geometry-aware layer on top of the raw edit primitives. For low-level row edits (`update_rows`, `delete_rows`, `add_rows`) and querying across foreign keys, see [Query and update linked tables](query-and-update.md).

## Quick example

Open a session, merge nodes that sit almost on top of each other, and exit cleanly so the edit commits. `merge_close_nodes` rewrites the `from_node_id` / `to_node_id` foreign key on every incident link to point at the surviving node — the whole point of doing it inside a session:

```python
import gmnspy
from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth
from gmnspy.clean import merge_close_nodes
from datagrove.editing import Session

net = gmnspy.read(leavenworth.csv_dir())
print(f"before: {net.nodes.count()} nodes, {net.links.count()} links")

# Leavenworth's coords are WGS84 degrees, so threshold_m is in degrees:
# 0.0005 deg ≈ 56 m at this latitude. Closest nodes are ~27 m apart, so
# this deliberately-large threshold collapses 11 of them.
with Session(net) as s:
    node_edit, link_edit = merge_close_nodes(net, s, threshold_m=0.0005)
    print(f"merged away {node_edit.diff.rows_removed} nodes; "
          f"rewrote FKs on {link_edit.diff.rows_changed} links")

print(f"after:  {net.nodes.count()} nodes")
```

If the `with` block raises instead, the session reverses every op and `net` is back to its pre-edit state.

## Step-by-step

### 1. Install

The `[clean]` extra brings in the geometry stack the ops depend on — `shapely`, `geopandas`, `igraph`, `pyproj`:

```bash
pip install 'gmnspy[clean]'
```

### 2. Open a Session

A `Session` wraps the network in an editable, transactional view. Inside the `with` block you pass *both* `net` and `s` into each op — the op reads state from `net` and records its change on `s` so the session can undo it later:

```python
import gmnspy
from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth
from datagrove.editing import Session

net = gmnspy.read(leavenworth.csv_dir())
with Session(net) as s:
    ...  # editing ops go here — see the next step
```

### 3. Apply one or more ops

Multiple ops in the same `with` block share one transactional boundary — rollback undoes all of them. A realistic cleanup pass merges coincident nodes, then sweeps up any node the merge left with no incident links:

```python
import gmnspy
from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth
from gmnspy.clean import merge_close_nodes, remove_orphans
from datagrove.editing import Session

net = gmnspy.read(leavenworth.csv_dir())
with Session(net) as s:
    node_edit, link_edit = merge_close_nodes(net, s, threshold_m=0.0005)
    orphan_edit = remove_orphans(net, s)
    print(f"merge removed {node_edit.diff.rows_removed} nodes; "
          f"orphan sweep removed {orphan_edit.diff.rows_removed} more")
```

Each op returns an `EditResult` (note: `merge_close_nodes` touches two tables, so it returns a **list** of two — one for `node`, one for `link`). An `EditResult` carries three fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `.diff` | `Diff` | Per-table counts: `rows_added`, `rows_removed`, `rows_changed`, plus capped before/after samples. Cheap to print / log. |
| `.edit` | `Edit` | The underlying op (op name, target table, payload). |
| `.rollback_data` | `Any` | The state captured before the op ran — opaque, consumed by `Session.rollback()` / `datagrove.editing.rollback`. |

`EditResult` also carries `.applied_at` (timestamp) and `.session_id`.

### 4. Commit or rollback

Clean exit from the `with` block commits all ops. An exception or an explicit `s.rollback()` reverses them in LIFO order:

```python
import gmnspy
from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth
from gmnspy.clean import merge_close_nodes, remove_orphans
from datagrove.editing import Session

net = gmnspy.read(leavenworth.csv_dir())

# Commit:
with Session(net) as s:
    remove_orphans(net, s)
# committed at __exit__

# Rollback by raising — net is restored to the pre-edit state:
before = net.nodes.count()
try:
    with Session(net) as s:
        merge_close_nodes(net, s, threshold_m=0.0005)
        raise RuntimeError("changed my mind")
except RuntimeError:
    pass
assert net.nodes.count() == before

# Rollback explicitly while staying in the block:
with Session(net) as s:
    node_edit, _ = merge_close_nodes(net, s, threshold_m=0.0005)
    if node_edit.diff.rows_removed > 100:
        s.rollback()  # too aggressive — undo
```

### 5. Persist the edit log (optional)

Pass `log_path=` to write a chronological record of each op (name, params, diff, rollback blob) to a sidecar parquet. The log is the only way to undo edits across process boundaries:

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
with Session(net, log_path="history.parquet") as s:
    merge_close_nodes(net, s, threshold_m=0.0005)
    remove_orphans(net, s)
```

Later, in a fresh process, replay the log to undo every recorded op in LIFO order:

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
from gmnspy import Network
from datagrove.editing import rollback

net = Network.from_source("./edited.parquet")
rollback(net, log_path="history.parquet")  # replay in LIFO
```

### 6. Write the result

Persist the edited network with `net.write(...)`. An edit marks the touched tables dirty, so writing emits a benign `OutOfSyncWarning` (the validator's foreign-key index hasn't been re-resolved against the edited rows — tracked in [#164](https://github.com/e-lo/GMNSpy/issues/164)). Suppress it for the write, exactly as the CLI does:

<!-- doctest: skip -->
```python
import warnings
from datagrove.dataset.package import OutOfSyncWarning

with warnings.catch_warnings():
    warnings.simplefilter("ignore", OutOfSyncWarning)
    net.write("./leavenworth-edited.parquet", overwrite=False)
```

The warning is informational: it tells you the in-memory FK index reflects the pre-edit rows. A fresh `gmnspy.read` of the written network re-resolves the index from scratch, and `gmnspy validate` re-checks the foreign keys.

## Common variations

???+ note "Default — transactional block with a single op"
    Most common pattern: open session, run one op, exit cleanly to commit.

    ```python
    import gmnspy
    from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth
    from gmnspy.clean import remove_orphans
    from datagrove.editing import Session

    net = gmnspy.read(leavenworth.csv_dir())
    with Session(net) as s:
        remove_orphans(net, s)
    ```

??? note "Chain multiple ops in one atomic block"
    All-or-nothing: rollback undoes the whole batch.

    ```python
    import gmnspy
    from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth
    from gmnspy.clean import merge_close_nodes, remove_orphans
    from datagrove.editing import Session

    net = gmnspy.read(leavenworth.csv_dir())
    with Session(net) as s:
        merge_close_nodes(net, s, threshold_m=0.0005)
        remove_orphans(net, s)
    ```

??? note "Preview without committing"
    `--dry-run` on the CLI runs the op, prints the diff, and reverts before exit.

    ```bash
    gmnspy clean merge-close-nodes <src> --threshold-m 0.0005 --dry-run
    ```

??? note "Run one op from the shell"
    Useful in pipelines; the CLI opens the session, writes the result, and suppresses the dirty-write warning for you.

    ```bash
    gmnspy clean remove-orphans <src> --dest ./out.parquet
    ```

??? note "Capture the diff for a log line"
    `EditResult` renders as a card in notebooks (`_repr_html_`); in plain code, read the `.diff` counts directly.

    ```python
    import gmnspy
    from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth
    from gmnspy.clean import merge_close_nodes
    from datagrove.editing import Session

    net = gmnspy.read(leavenworth.csv_dir())
    with Session(net) as s:
        node_edit, _ = merge_close_nodes(net, s, threshold_m=0.0005)
    d = node_edit.diff
    print(f"+{d.rows_added} / -{d.rows_removed} / ~{d.rows_changed}")
    ```

??? note "Geometry ops need an inline geometry column"
    `simplify_geometry` and `recompute_lengths` read an inline `geometry` (WKT) column on the link table. Leavenworth carries geometry in a separate `geometry` table via `link.geometry_id`, so assemble it onto the links first:

    ```python
    import gmnspy
    from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth
    from gmnspy.semantics import assemble_link_geometry

    net = gmnspy.read(leavenworth.csv_dir())
    geom = assemble_link_geometry(net)   # link_id, geometry_wkt, source
    print(f"assembled WKT for {geom.num_rows} links")
    ```

    Or run the op through the CLI, which handles assembly + write:

    ```bash
    gmnspy clean simplify-geometry <src> --mode douglas_peucker --tolerance 0.00001
    ```

## Pitfalls

* **`threshold_m` is in coordinate units, not always meters.** The name reflects the common projected case. On a WGS84 (lat/lon) network like Leavenworth the units are *degrees* — `0.0005` ≈ 56 m. Pass a value in your network's CRS units, not a string like `"2m"`.
* **`merge_close_nodes` returns a list, not one `EditResult`.** It touches two tables (`node` + `link`), so it returns `[node_result, link_result]`. The single-table ops (`remove_orphans`, `simplify_geometry`, `recompute_lengths`) return one `EditResult`.
* **`simplify_geometry` / `recompute_lengths` require an inline `geometry` column.** If your network carries geometry via `geometry_id`, assemble it first with `gmnspy.semantics.assemble_link_geometry` (see the variation above) or use the CLI, which does it for you.
* **`OutOfSyncWarning` on write is expected after an edit** ([#164](https://github.com/e-lo/GMNSpy/issues/164)). It means the in-memory FK index still reflects the pre-edit rows; it is not an error. Suppress it for the write (step 6) — re-reading the written network rebuilds the index.
* **A 100%-null column can break the write** ([#163](https://github.com/e-lo/GMNSpy/issues/163)). Writing an edited table through the ibis/duckdb engine can fail when a column is entirely null (e.g. Leavenworth's `node.name`). Workaround until the fix lands: load through a different engine for the edit-then-save step — `gmnspy.read(src, engine=resolve_engine("pandas"))` (from `datagrove.engines`), the programmatic equivalent of the CLI's `--engine pandas`.
* **Don't mutate tables outside the session.** Direct `net.links.expr.execute().assign(...)` writes bypass the session entirely and aren't rollback-able.
* **The session captures snapshots, not journals.** Memory cost scales with the size of the tables an op touches; the bulk `replace_table` path snapshots the whole affected table. Long sessions over large networks should commit periodically.
