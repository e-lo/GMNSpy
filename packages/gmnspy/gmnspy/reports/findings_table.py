"""CSV / XLSX writers for a list of validation :class:`~datagrove.reports.Issue` objects.

The two writers share a column set so a spreadsheet downloaded from one
format mirrors the other. The serialised columns are the
:class:`~datagrove.reports.Issue` dataclass fields plus an ``extra``
JSON column (so adapter-specific payload like FK targets or OSM ids
survives the round-trip without needing per-rule column expansion).
