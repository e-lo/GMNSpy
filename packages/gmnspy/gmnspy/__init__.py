    Thin wrapper around :meth:`Network.validate` — exists so the
    documented top-level form ``gmnspy.validate(...)`` works without
    callers needing to load a :class:`Network` first.

    If ``source`` is already a :class:`Network`, calls ``.validate()``
    on it directly. Otherwise loads via :func:`gmnspy.read` first.

    Args:
        source: A :class:`Network`, or anything :func:`read` accepts
            (local path, URL, package directory).
        engine: Engine to materialise through. Only consulted when
            ``source`` is a path — ignored when it's already a Network.
        spec_version: GMNS spec version to validate against. Only
            consulted when ``source`` is a path.
        schema: Run the per-field schema check pass (types, enums,
            constraints). Default ``True``.
        structural: Run the package-structure pass (required tables,
            file presence). Default ``True``.
        foreign_keys: Run the FK referential-integrity pass. Default
            ``True``.
        sync_state: Stamp + check FK staleness against the
            :class:`~datagrove.validation.sync_state.DirtyTracker`.
            Default ``True``.
        strict: Treat warnings as errors — caller can ``raise`` on
            any non-clean report. Default ``False``.

    Returns:
        A :class:`~datagrove.reports.ValidationReport` whose
        ``spec_version`` field is stamped with the GMNS version the
        data was checked against.

    Examples:
        >>> import gmnspy
        >>> from gmnspy.fixtures import leavenworth
        >>> report = gmnspy.validate(leavenworth.csv_dir())

    Thin convenience wrapper around :meth:`Network.from_source` — exists

            or directory of CSV / Parquet / DuckDB / zipped-CSV files
            containing the GMNS package.
        engine: Engine to materialise through. Defaults to the
            datagrove default (typically the ibis + DuckDB engine).
        spec_version: GMNS spec version to validate against. Defaults
            to :data:`DEFAULT_SPEC` (currently ``"0.97"``); must be one
            of :data:`SUPPORTED_SPECS`.
        tables: Optional iterable of table names to partial-load.

    Returns:
        A :class:`Network` whose tables are lazy ibis expressions.
