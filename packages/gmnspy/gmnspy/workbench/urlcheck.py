"""The wizard's URL **Check**: is a remote GMNS source reachable, which credential layer applies, what's in it.

Read-only and never records an action. It reports the *name* of the credential source
(``env``/``keyring``/``netrc``/``none``, from :func:`datagrove.io.credentials.credential_source`),
never a credential value, and lists table names only (no data is read).

This probes an arbitrary ``http(s)``/``s3``/``gs``/``az``/... host supplied by the caller; it is meant
for the workbench's local, single-user server, not for exposure to untrusted callers. ``check_url``
itself never raises: every failure, including a bug in this module's own error handling, is reported
back as ``error`` rather than propagated.
