"""Background jobs: one thread per job, staged progress pushed as ``job`` events, cooperative cancel.

A job function receives a :class:`JobContext`. It calls ``ctx.stage(name, ...)`` at each stage
boundary; that publishes progress and is also the cancellation checkpoint (it raises
:class:`~gmnspy.workbench.errors.JobCancelled` once :meth:`JobRunner.cancel` was called). Work
inside one stage (an Overpass download, a DuckDB read) is not interrupted, so a cancel takes
effect at the next boundary. A cancel that arrives after the last checkpoint does not undo the
work: the job ends ``status="done"`` with ``cancel_requested=True``.

A job's ``result`` is published in every later event and kept for the session's lifetime, so it
must be small, JSON-able, and never mutated after the job function returns.

Thread-safety: every mutation of a :class:`Job` and every snapshot of it (``to_dict``) happens
under the runner's lock. The runner never touches session state; the ``on_finish`` callback
(run on the job thread, before the job is marked finished for :meth:`Job.wait`) is where the
session records history.

Events: ``_emit`` snapshots and publishes under a separate emit lock, so events go out in the
order their snapshots were taken (a stale ``running`` snapshot can never follow the terminal
one). The runner lock is never held while publishing. ``publish`` must therefore be
non-blocking and must not call back into the runner or take the session lock
(``EventBus.publish`` qualifies). The terminal event is published before :meth:`Job.wait`
returns. ``cancel`` on a finished job publishes nothing, so every terminal event is published
after ``on_finish`` ran and carries the ``history_seq`` it set.

A job can never stay ``running`` forever: whatever fails (``publish``, starting the thread, the
job function, even with a ``BaseException``), the job ends ``failed`` and :meth:`Job.wait`
returns.
