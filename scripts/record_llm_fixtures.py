"""Re-record the LLM contract fixtures from the live provider APIs.

    GMNSPY_RECORD_LLM_FIXTURES=1 uv run --all-extras python scripts/record_llm_fixtures.py anthropic [openai gemini ollama]

Uses your configured keys -- environment variables, then the OS keyring, both through
:class:`~gmnspy.llm.secrets.SecretStore` (never a plaintext file) -- and each fixture's model and
utterance. Writes only the response JSON and the request's top-level body keys, and scrubs the
API key (and anything key-shaped) out of every string in the response before it is written, so no
key reaches disk even if a provider ever echoed part of one back. Request and response HEADERS
are never written to the fixture at all: they are the one place the key definitely travels, so
this script never even looks at them beyond handing them to ``httpx`` for the live call.

Running this hits every live provider API named on the command line and overwrites its committed
fixture, so it refuses to run at all unless ``GMNSPY_RECORD_LLM_FIXTURES=1`` is set -- that is the
only guard against an accidental invocation (a stray "run this" in an editor, a copy-pasted
command) spending real tokens and quota and silently rewriting the contract fixtures.

Review the diff (and re-check "expected") before committing.
